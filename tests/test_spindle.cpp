// The Spindle, and the sub-unit round trip (DESIGN.md 7.5.1) -- the two halves of
// the shared disk substrate, tested before either floppy board exists to use them.
//
// What is actually at stake in each:
//
//   THE SPINDLE. Rotation is derived from the clock and never from a counter, so the
//   property to pin is that NOTHING THE GUEST DOES CHANGES THE DISK'S SPEED. Reading
//   the sector port a thousand times must not advance the disk by one sector. That is
//   the bug the design is built to make impossible, so it is the first test here.
//
//   THE ROUND TRIP. subUnits() is addSubUnit()'s inverse, which is a claim you can
//   simply execute: render a board's sub-units, feed the text straight back in, and
//   the second board must equal the first. Before this existed, a controller's drives
//   would LOAD AND SILENTLY NOT SAVE -- so the test is not "does it print something",
//   it is "does the machine survive a save/load cycle intact".
