// THE SANDBOX TESTS, AND THESE ARE THE IMPORTANT ONES.
//
// Everything else about the Host Bridge is a state machine, and a state machine that
// is wrong is a transfer that fails loudly. THIS is the part that is wrong quietly:
// a guest program that can name a file outside `hostdir` can read your ssh key or
// overwrite your shell profile, and nothing about the transfer it performs looks any
// different from a working one.
//
// SO THIS TEST TOUCHES A REAL FILESYSTEM, deliberately, and it is the only test in
// the tree that does so on purpose rather than for want of a fake. A symlink escape
// CANNOT be tested against a MemHostDir, because a fake filesystem has no symlinks to
// escape through -- and the symlink is the escape that the text-level name checks
// cannot see, because `evil.txt` is a perfectly legal filename right up until the
// moment the filesystem tells you where it points.
