# THE HISTORY FILE IS FOR A HUMAN AT A TERMINAL, AND FOR NOBODY ELSE.
#
# The monitor persists its command history to .swtpcsim_history in the directory it was
# launched from -- but ONLY when a real person is typing at a real terminal. A script
# (-x/-s), a pipe, the test suite, and --mcp must leave the directory exactly as they
# found it: a build that scribbled a dotfile into whatever directory CI happened to run
# in would be a surprise at best and a diff at worst.
#
# This proves the NEGATIVE, which is the whole guarantee: two non-tty launches in a fresh
# directory, and no file afterward. The guard is LineEditor::interactive() -- stdin AND
# stdout both a tty -- so a pipe fails it even on the interactive code path.
#
# pty/pipe trap (swtpcsim's own note, PR #85): a pipe is not a tty, so we cannot drive the
# POSITIVE case here (an interactive session actually WRITING the file) -- that needs an
# expect/pty harness like tests/acceptance/cli.exp. This file asserts the guard and nothing
# more, which is exactly what the requirement asks.
#
# Expects: -DSIM=<swtpcsim> -DBIN=<binary dir>
