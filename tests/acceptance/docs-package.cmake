# THE PRODUCER'S MANIFEST AND THE READER'S MANIFEST MUST AGREE.
#
# Two files describe what ships. `docs/package.map` is the producer's view -- the single
# source of truth tools/build-package.sh assembles the zip from. `docs/manual/package.md` is
# the reader's view -- the "What is in the package" chapter, the first thing a person opening
# the archive reads. DISTRIBUTION.md says it in one line: "docs/manual/package.md must then
# name it too, because the manual may only name paths that actually ship." Add LICENSE-SDL3 to
# the map and not the manual, or the other way round, and the two drift -- silently, because
# nothing reads both.
#
# This is the CHEAP HALF of "check the manual against the package". It is a text comparison of
# two files in the tree: no build, no packaging, no binary. It does NOT assemble the zip and
# run the manual's own commands against it -- that expensive half still needs build-package.sh
# under a workflow, and package.map's own header says so. What this catches is the drift the
# blacklist in docs-manual.cmake cannot see: that grep proves the manual names nothing OUTSIDE
# the package; this proves the manual and the map name the SAME set inside it.
#
# It is not hypothetical. The exact bug it guards against sat in the tree: the manual promised
# `examples/debugger` while the map did not ship it, found only by reading the two files side
# by side. This is that read, automated.
#
# Expects: -DSRC=<source dir>

# This runs as a standalone `cmake -P` script, so it carries no policies from the project's
# CMakeLists. Without this line CMP0057 is unset and the `name IN_LIST ship` test below is an
# ERROR under OLD behaviour -- which is why this passed on one runner's CMake and failed the
# others. Match the project's floor (top-level CMakeLists) so IN_LIST is the operator it reads as.
