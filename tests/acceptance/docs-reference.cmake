# THE REFERENCE CHAPTERS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GO STALE.
#
# docs/manual/ref/*.md is printed from Board::properties() and the CommandDef table -- the
# same reflection layer the monitor, the TOML loader, CONFIG SAVE and MCP all resolve
# against. Committing that output buys a reader (and the PDF build) a reference with no
# toolchain, but it buys it at the usual price: a copy can rot.
#
# So this test regenerates into a temp directory and diffs. Change a property's default,
# add a board, reword a HELP string, and this goes red until you re-run:
#
#     cmake --build build --target docs-reference
#
# It is the same instinct as platform_lint being a build dependency rather than a nicety:
# a rule you can merge and fix later is a rule you have already lost.
#
# Expects: -DGEN=<swtpc_genref> -DSRC=<source dir> -DBIN=<binary dir>
