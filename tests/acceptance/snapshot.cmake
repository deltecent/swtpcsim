# SNAPSHOT / RESTORE, through the REAL monitor (DESIGN.md 13).
#
# The unit tests (tests/test_snapshot.cpp) prove the state round-trips at the
# machine API; this proves the two COMMANDS are wired -- that SNAPSHOT writes a
# file the operator named, that RESTORE reads it back into a running machine, and
# that a file which is not a snapshot is refused with a reason rather than crashing.
#
# Piped, not a pty: it asserts only what the machine says on its own (the monitor's
# own SNAPSHOT/RESTORE/REGS output), never a keystroke typed at a guest.
#
# Expects: -DSIM=<swtpcsim> -DBIN=<binary dir>
