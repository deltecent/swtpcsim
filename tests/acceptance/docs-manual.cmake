# THE SHIPPED DOCUMENTS MAY NOT NAME ANYTHING THE READER DOES NOT HAVE.
#
# The manual -- and the two documents split out of it that also ship, docs/monitor/ and
# docs/debugger/ -- go inside the distribution: the `swtpcsim` binary, the documentation, and
# the examples/ tree. That is all a reader gets. There is no src/, no CMakeLists, no DESIGN.md,
# no docs/boards/, no checkout.
#
# So "the shipped documents are self-contained" is a rule, and a rule that is merely INTENDED is
# a rule that is already lost -- somebody adds one helpful "see src/core/bus.h" and it is true of
# a document nobody can follow. It erodes exactly one line at a time, in good faith, and nobody
# notices until a user does.
#
# This test is the rule, made mechanical. It greps every shipped document's sources (see
# `shipdirs` below) for anything that points outside the package, and it fails.
#
# THE DEVELOPER GUIDE (docs/devguide/) IS DELIBERATELY NOT CHECKED. It is repo-only, it is
# where the source lives, and telling a board author to read board.h is the whole point of it.
#
# Expects: -DSRC=<source dir>

# THE SHIPPED, SELF-CONTAINED DOCUMENTS. The manual, plus the two documents split out of it
# that ALSO ship in the package -- docs/monitor/ (swtpcsim-monitor.pdf) and docs/debugger/
# (swtpcsim-debugger.pdf). Each is handed to a reader who has only the zip, so each must name
# nothing outside the package, and each has its OWN ORDER. The Developer Guide is deliberately
# NOT here: it is repo-only and may talk about the source.
