// The Clock, and its event queue (DESIGN.md 7.5).
//
// The queue exists for ONE reason and it is worth stating before the tests: a
// board must be able to act at a moment when NOBODY IS ASKING IT ANYTHING. A 6850
// whose transmit register drains while the guest sits in a HLT waiting for exactly
// that interrupt is the case, and if the only thing that could wake the card is
// the CPU that is halted waiting for it, the machine is dead.
//
// So what is tested here is not "a callback fires". It is the three properties a
// board's correctness rests on:
//
//   1. ORDER IS TOTAL AND DETERMINISTIC. Same schedule -> same firing order, on
//      every host, in every replay. Ties break by scheduling order, not by address
//      and not by luck.
//   2. A CANCELLED EVENT NEVER FIRES, and cancelling a dead handle is legal --
//      boards re-arm on every character and cannot be asked to track which.
//   3. NOTHING FIRES EARLY, and everything due inside one instruction fires at
//      that instruction's boundary. Emulated time is the only clock there is.
