// The number base (DESIGN.md 10.1).
//
// PATRICK'S RULE, 2026-07-11:
//   "ON THE WIRE -> HEX.  NEVER ON THE WIRE -> DECIMAL."
//   "Suffixes like K and M are always behind decimal numbers."
//
// The base belongs to the OPERAND, not to the command line. An address, a port
// and a data byte are things the 8080 itself sees, and they are hex. A count, a
// width, a size, a baud rate and a unit number never leave the operator's head,
// and they are decimal.
//
// A single global base was never actually available: `baud=9600` cannot mean
// 38400, so the rule had to bend SOMEWHERE. Given that, it bends where it means
// something.
//
// The failure this catches is the quiet kind. Every one of these tokens parses
// fine under the wrong base -- `20` is a perfectly good number either way -- so
// nothing crashes and nothing complains. You just step 32 times when you asked
// for 20, or size a card at 16K when you wrote 10K, and you find out later.
