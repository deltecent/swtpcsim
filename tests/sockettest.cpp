// THE SOCKET LAYER, ON THE REAL NETWORK STACK.
//
// tests/test_lines.cpp already drives a `socket:` endpoint over loopback and proves
// the happy path: a client connects, DCD rises, bytes cross, the client hangs up and
// carrier drops. That runs in the `unit` aggregate and needs nothing but a free port.
//
// This is the half that loopback-in-one-process does NOT reach: the NON-BLOCKING
// CONNECT, both when it succeeds against a real listener and -- the one that matters --
// when it is REFUSED. docs/porting-notes.md named the refusal as the single most
// likely thing to be wrong on Winsock, because a non-blocking connect reports failure
// by landing in select()'s THIRD fd_set (the except set) that POSIX ignores, and a
// port scanner that read that set wrong would see every dead port as a live one.
//
// It uses only platform/socket.h -- no OS type crosses the boundary, so §2.1 is happy
// and this file builds and runs identically on every host. It is labelled `hw` not
// because it needs a cable but because, like serialtest, it touches the real world:
// the kernel's TCP stack, not a ScriptedStream.
