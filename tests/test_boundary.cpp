// The bus/board boundary (DESIGN.md 4, 4.6.1).
//
// PATRICK'S RULE, 2026-07-11:
//   "The only thing the bus should do is provide FF if no RAM or IO is processed
//    by a board. There should be minimal bus/board overlap."
//
// So 0xFF is the BUS's, and it means exactly one thing: NOBODY DROVE THIS CYCLE.
// A board must never manufacture 0xFF, because if it does, the one signal the bus
// has stops being a signal. Uninitialized RAM and an empty socket are completely
// different faults, and they must not look the same.
//
// The failure this catches is a quiet one. Seed a board's store with 0xFF -- it is
// the obvious "uninitialized" filler, and it is what this code did until Patrick
// caught it -- and DUMP shows FF for a card whose RAM is fine, FF for a card whose
// RAM was never filled, and FF for a card that is not there. One symptom, three
// causes, and you will chase the wrong one.
