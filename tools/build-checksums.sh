# SHA256SUMS for a release -- the one file that lets swtpcsim.com and the GitHub
# Release be checked against each other, and lets anyone who downloads an archive
# check what they got. See DISTRIBUTION.md 6 and 8.
#
# COORDINATOR ONLY, and AFTER all four archives have collected in dist/. A checksum
# file is worthless until every file it vouches for is present -- three of four is
# WORSE than none, because someone runs `-c`, sees three OK lines, and ships a release
# whose fourth archive nobody checked. So this REFUSES unless all four packages of one
# version are here (DISTRIBUTION.md 1):
#
#     swtpcsim-X.Y.Z-macos-arm64.tar.gz
#     swtpcsim-X.Y.Z-macos-x86_64.tar.gz
#     swtpcsim-X.Y.Z-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
#     swtpcsim-X.Y.Z-windows-x86_64.zip
#
# It writes dist/SHA256SUMS in the standard `shasum -a 256` / `sha256sum` format --
# "<hash>  <name>", two spaces, BARE names -- so `shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS`
# verifies it from inside dist/ and from inside an unpacked download alike. Then it
# verifies its OWN output before claiming success, because a checksum file nobody has
# checked is a draft, same as everything else in this pipeline.
#
# It does NOT upload. Like build-package.sh, it produces an artifact and stops; the
# coordinator uploads SHA256SUMS beside the four archives (DISTRIBUTION.md 5 step 6).
