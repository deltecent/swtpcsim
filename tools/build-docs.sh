# THIS IS NOT PART OF THE BUILD, and it must never become part of it. swtpcsim's loudest
# claim is that it builds with a C++20 compiler and CMake and nothing else -- no
# downloads, no package manager. A PDF needs pandoc and a browser, and neither of them is
# allowed anywhere near the thing that produces the simulator. So: a separate script, and
# a CMake target that is SKIPPED with a message when the tools are absent.
#
# There is no LaTeX here on purpose. pandoc's PDF writer wants a TeX engine (a gigabyte of
# it), and we do not need one: pandoc emits a self-contained HTML page and a browser prints
# it. Chrome's --print-to-pdf is a real, paginating print path -- it is what the browser
# does when you hit Cmd-P -- and it renders the CSS we already have to write for the
# HTML anyway.

# hook is wired here: window.PagedConfig.after stamps the page count into document.title, and
# chrome-print.py watches for it.
#
# Then it CHECKS THE RESULT. If Paged.js had silently not run, the browser would have printed
# the un-paginated document -- no footer page numbers, an un-numbered contents -- and it would
# look plausible. So we read the finished PDF back and fail the build if the running page
