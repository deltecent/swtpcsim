rem Build a STATIC SDL3 for packaging, into a fixed prefix. Run ONCE per build machine.
rem
rem   usage: tools\build-sdl3-static.bat [prefix]     default: %%USERPROFILE%%\opt\sdl3-static
rem
rem This is the Windows half of tools/build-sdl3-static.sh; the two pin the SAME SDL3
rem version on purpose. See that file for why static linking rather than bundling, and
rem DISTRIBUTION.md 3.2 for the measurements.
rem
rem   VERIFIED on Windows 10 (MSVC 2022 Build Tools), 2026-07-22: a from-scratch run built
rem   and installed a static SDL3 3.4.12 in ~3.5 min (exit 0 -- SDL3-static.lib, headers,
rem   cmake config, version marker), and the idempotent "already installed" path works too.
rem   See DISTRIBUTION.md 8. Written 2026-07-20 from the working macOS script.
rem
rem WHY A .BAT AND NOT A .PS1. PowerShell's execution policy blocks unsigned .ps1 files by
rem default, so a script somebody just cloned will not run without them changing a machine
rem setting first. A .bat has no such gate. curl.exe and tar.exe have shipped in Windows
rem since 10 1803, so the download and unpack need nothing installed either.
rem
rem NO DEVELOPER SHELL IS REQUIRED. The Visual Studio generator invokes MSBuild, which
rem locates the toolchain itself -- see docs/building-windows.md.

set SDL3_VERSION=3.4.12

rem THE CRT MUST MATCH, AND THIS IS THE WINDOWS-ONLY TRAP. MSVC links the C runtime
rem dynamically by default (/MD), so the .exe then needs the VC++ redistributable -- which
rem is present on most Windows 10 machines and absent on a clean one, and a package that
rem requires an install first is a broken package. Building everything with the STATIC CRT
rem (/MT) removes that. But SDL3 and swtpcsim must agree: mixing /MT and /MD gives
rem duplicate-symbol link errors at best, and two separate C runtime heaps at worst.
rem So it is set here AND must be set on the swtpcsim build. Both, or neither.
