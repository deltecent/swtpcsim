// gen-reference -- the manual's reference chapters, emitted from the binary.
//
// WHY THIS IS A PROGRAM AND NOT A HAND-WRITTEN CHAPTER.
//
// A board's properties() ARE its TOML keys (DESIGN.md 5). One reflection layer already
// backs SET, SHOW, the TOML loader, CONFIG SAVE, the MCP tool schemas and tab completion,
// and the project's whole claim is that there is NO SECOND SCHEMA ANYWHERE. A parameter
// table typed into a Markdown file would be exactly that second schema -- and it would be
// wrong immediately. It was: while planning this manual, a careful reader with
// s100-memory.cpp open wrote a defaults table for the memory card that was wrong in three
// of eight rows (honors_phantom, phantom and fill are all/all/random, not none/none/zero).
//
// So the reference is PRINTED, not retyped. This is the fourth consumer of the reflection
// layer, and it is modelled on the third -- src/mcp/server.cpp already builds MCP schemas
// out of properties() the same way.
//
// WHY IT IS C++ AND NOT A SHELL SCRIPT OVER THE CLI. No single command emits what a table
// needs: `BOARDS TYPES` gives a property's name and help but no default and no range, and
// `SHOW <id>` gives its value and range but no help. A script would have to rejoin two
// lossy TEXT projections of structs we already hold in memory -- the second-schema sin
// again, one level up, in the least testable place available.
//
// The output is committed under docs/manual/ref/ and docs/monitor/ref/, and a ctest re-runs
// this and diffs. Edit a properties() and forget the docs, and the suite goes red.
//
// The board, machine and cheatsheet tables go in the User Manual's ref dir; the command
// reference goes in the Monitor's, because that is the document it belongs to. Two dirs, so:
//
//   gen-reference <manual-ref-dir> <monitor-ref-dir>
