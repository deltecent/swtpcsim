# Build a STATIC SDL3 for packaging, into a fixed prefix. Run ONCE per build machine.
#
#   usage: tools/build-sdl3-static.sh [prefix]        default: ~/opt/sdl3-static
#   env:   SDL3_BUILD_JOBS=N   cap the parallel build to N jobs (default: all cores)
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A distributed package must run on a machine that has never had SDL3
# installed. Linking the system SDL3 does not achieve that: on macOS a Homebrew build
# links /opt/homebrew/opt/sdl3/lib/libSDL3.0.dylib BY ABSOLUTE PATH, so the binary starts
# on the machine that built it and nowhere else. The alternative to static linking is to
# copy the library into the package and rewrite the install name (install_name_tool,
# @rpath, $ORIGIN) -- three steps, each of which can be got wrong silently.
#
# Static costs about 0.3 MB and removes all three. Measured on macOS/arm64 2026-07-20:
# a dynamic swtpcsim is 1.7 MB plus a 2.4 MB dylib it must carry; the static one is
# 4.4 MB and carries nothing. `otool -L` on it names only system frameworks.
#
# HOMEBREW CANNOT DO THIS. `brew install sdl3` ships libSDL3.0.dylib and no static
# library at all -- the one .a in there is libSDL3_test.a, which is SDL's test harness,
# not SDL. SDL3Config.cmake even names an SDL3::SDL3-static target, but there is no
# SDL3staticTargets.cmake to define it. Hence a source build.
#
# THE VERSION IS PINNED HERE, AND THAT IS THE POINT. Each build machine keeps its own
# SDL3 (DISTRIBUTION.md 3.1) and nothing at release time checks that four machines agree.
# This file is the agreement. Change it deliberately, and rerun this script everywhere.
#
# WINDOWS HAS ITS OWN: tools/build-sdl3-static.bat, which pins the same version. It is a
# .bat rather than a .ps1 because PowerShell's execution policy blocks unsigned scripts by
# default, and it carries one trap this file does not -- the MSVC C runtime must match
# between SDL3 and swtpcsim (/MT vs /MD), or the link fails or the two get separate heaps.
# It is UNVERIFIED; nobody has run it. See docs/building-windows.md.
