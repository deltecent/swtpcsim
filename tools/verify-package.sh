# PROVE THE MANUAL IS TRUE AGAINST THE ACTUAL SHIPPED PACKAGE.
#
# tools/build-package.sh assembles the archive we hand people and STOPS -- it never runs the
# manual's own commands against it, so a chapter can tell a reader to type something that does
# not work in the zip and nothing catches it. That is not hypothetical: the manual promised
# "CP/M in one command" while a published archive carried no media at all (docs/package.map
# and issue #308 record it). This script is the missing half. It takes the finished archive,
# extracts it somewhere `git rev-parse` FAILS -- no repository in sight, exactly the layout a
# user has -- and types the manual's own fenced `$ swtpcsim ...` commands at the binary that
# is actually in the package, asserting each reaches the prompt the manual says it will.
#
# WHY A SEPARATE SCRIPT, and not a step inside build-package.sh or a ctest case:
#   * build-package.sh's job is to ASSEMBLE AND STOP (like build-checksums.sh). Verifying a
#     finished artifact is a different job, and must be re-runnable against an already-built
#     archive without a rebuild -- which folding it into the packager would forbid.
#   * ctest runs BEFORE packaging (DISTRIBUTION.md 4.2 step 4) and proves the BINARY, not the
#     archive. The archive only exists at release time, and only then do the PDFs (docs.yml)
#     and the windowed-SDL binary that build-package.sh's own gates require exist. So this is
#     a release-time check, wired into DISTRIBUTION.md 4.2 after build-package.sh, not CI.
#
# WHERE THE COMMANDS AND THE PROMPTS COME FROM. The commands are read from the manual SOURCE
# (docs/manual/*.md in this checkout -- the package ships only the rendered PDF), token-expanded
# from docs/package.map with the SAME substitution build-package.sh uses, so the two can never
# disagree about what {{MACHINE_FLEX}} means. Extraction is open-ended (any fenced one-liner is a
# candidate); DISPATCH is a small closed table, and a documented example this table does not
# know is a LOUD FAILURE ("add it here"), never a silent skip. That asymmetry is the point: a
# new `$ swtpcsim {{MACHINE_NEWTHING}}` in a chapter cannot slip past unverified.
#
# BOTH DOCUMENTED EXAMPLES NEED A PTY, NOT A PIPE, which is not a preference -- the 6850 console
# read is polled, so a keystroke only lands while the guest is sitting in its read loop, and only
# a tty paces bytes to the emulated 9600 baud. They reuse acceptance `.exp` scripts pointed at the
# extracted package's own files: tests/acceptance/altair680-kcacr.exp runs from the package root
# against the shipped machine file, and flex-pkg.exp boots the shipped FLEX example to its +++
# prompt (its twin flex.exp drives the write-protected in-tree fixture instead, so it is not reused
# here).
#
# `expect` IS OPTIONAL, exactly as it is for the acceptance suite. CMakeLists gates every `.exp`
# test behind find_program(expect) and SKIPS them where it is absent -- which is Windows, whose
# Git Bash ships no expect. So this does the same: the pty commands are SKIPPED WITH A LOUD NOTICE
# rather than failing the leg. A skip is reported, never silent -- an unverified command must
# look unverified.
#
# NOT `set -e`. This harness RUNS commands that are expected to fail when the package is wrong
# -- a failed boot is a finding, not a script error -- so failures are handled explicitly and
# tallied, and the script's own exit status is the count of findings.
