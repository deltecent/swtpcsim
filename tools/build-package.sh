# THE CONTENTS COME FROM docs/package.map, and from nowhere else. That file is the single
# source of truth for three things that would otherwise drift: the tokens the manual writes
# ({{MACHINE_CPM}} and friends), the directories this script copies, and what the docs tests
# check. Add an example by adding a DIR line there -- not by editing this script.
#
# MOST DISK IMAGES ARE NOT IN GIT (*.dsk / *.DSK are gitignored: they are large and they are
# not ours to redistribute) -- but EVERY image this package ships is one of the tracked few
# that .gitignore names one at a time, so a fresh clone builds a zip that actually boots and
# nothing here has to be fetched first. That is what lets this script be strict: media missing
# from an example directory is a file that should be in your tree and is not, so it REFUSES TO
# PACKAGE rather than quietly shipping a folder with a machine file and no machine in it --
# which would boot to a dead prompt and look like our bug.

# headless binary runs `swtpcsim vdm1` perfectly happily and draws nothing. DISTRIBUTION.md

# machine may not have -- Git Bash on Windows has no `nm` -- and 7 records that `strings` gives
# a FALSE NEGATIVE here, because SDL_CreateWindow is a symbol and not a literal. SHOW VERSION
# carries a `video` row for this, so the answer is the same on all four machines.
# The row now names the compiled-in video backends and says "windowed (...)" ONLY when a
# real one (x11/wayland/cocoa/...) is present. A dummy-only SDL3 -- the Linux hole where no

# tar.gz everywhere but Windows. The Windows .zip is where the footguns are, and building one
# on the Win10 guest (2026-07-21) sprang every one:
#
#   * Git Bash ships NO Info-ZIP `zip`.
#   * Its `tar` is GNU tar (/usr/bin/tar), which CANNOT write zip -- `--format zip` is an
#     "Invalid archive format" and `-a -cf x.zip` yields a file `unzip` will not read. So the
#     old `tar --version | grep bsdtar` branch never fired here (bare tar is GNU tar), and had
#     it fired it would have run the wrong tar.
#   * PowerShell 5.1 -- what Windows 10 ships -- Compress-Archive writes BACKSLASH path
#     separators. The listing looks right and `unzip -t` passes, but actual extraction on any
#     Unix `unzip` FAILS ("appears to use backslashes as path separators"). PowerShell 7 fixed
#     it; the release box has 5.1.
#
# What DOES emit a conformant, forward-slash zip is bsdtar (libarchive) with `--format zip`.
# It ships in every Windows 10 1803+ as %SystemRoot%\System32\tar.exe -- absent only from Git
# Bash's PATH, where GNU tar shadows it. So find a REAL bsdtar (bare `tar` already is one on
# macOS; on Windows reach System32\tar.exe by absolute path) and prefer it. Compress-Archive
# stays as a last resort, but WARNS, because its output may not open off Windows.
