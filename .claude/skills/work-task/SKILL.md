description: How any change to swtpcsim is done, from plan to review — plan in plan mode (for a feature, first prove it is needed — not already documented, not a docs gap), branch, build, fix related bugs and file unrelated ones as issues, update the docs, test, then STOP for the maintainer's review. Use when starting or doing any task — fix a bug, fix issue #N, add a feature, change docs, refactor. Ends before any commit; committing is the ship-change skill.

# Do a task: plan, build, stop for review

This skill ends at a review. **It never commits and never pushes.** After the maintainer
approves the change, the `ship-change` skill takes over.

## 1. Plan, in plan mode

If you are not in plan mode, call `EnterPlanMode` first. **No edits before the plan is
approved** — not a "quick" one, not a probe left in the tree.

Research economy: read the memory index and run one targeted `grep` before you reach for an
agent. Read the relevant `DESIGN.md` section before you design anything.

**For a feature, do 1a first, inside plan mode** — it decides whether there is anything to
design. The plan names:

- the files to change
- the tests to add or run
- the docs to update
- how you will prove it works

Ask with `AskUserQuestion` only when different answers would lead to different work. Then
`ExitPlanMode`.

## 1a. A feature must earn its place

**When the task starts from an incoming issue, `review-issue` settles the verdict first** —
this step then builds on it rather than repeating it.

For a feature — anything that is not fixing a bug — settle this **before** designing anything:

1. **The need, in the requester's terms.** What were they trying to do, what did they try,
   and where did it fall short? A request that names a solution ("add a `--foo` flag") has a
   problem behind it; find the problem.
2. **Whether swtpcsim can already do it.** Search the manual, `HELP`, `docs/manual/ref/`,
   the machine files, and the existing commands and properties. If it can, there is no code
   to write, and one of two things is true:
   - **It is documented, and the requester did not find it.** Nothing changes: point them to
     the section or `HELP` entry, on the issue if there is one.
   - **It is not documented, or is too hard to find.** That is a real documentation gap; the
     fix is a docs change (a manual section, a `HELP` line, an example).
3. **Whether it was declined before.** Search closed issues and `DESIGN.md` for an earlier
   decision and its reason.
4. **Whether it fits.** Read the relevant `DESIGN.md` section. A feature that gives hardware a
   behavior it never had is a no.

**The plan opens with the verdict** — needed, already documented, a documentation gap, or
already declined — and the evidence for it. If the need is unclear, ask before planning. A
documentation gap makes the plan a docs change; already documented means no change at all.

## 2. Branch off an up-to-date master

```sh
git switch master && git pull --ff-only && git switch -c <type>/<slug>
```

`<type>` is `fix`, `feat`, `docs`, `test` or `refactor`, as in the commit messages.

## 3. Build it

### Tests prove the code; they never bend around it

When a test exposes a bug, the fix goes in the code. None of these is allowed:

- loosening an assertion, or widening a tolerance until it passes
- skipping, disabling or deleting the test
- changing the test's input so it no longer reaches the bug
- adding a retry or a sleep to hide a race
- recording known-bad output as the expected result

Prove a new test catches what it claims: break the fix, see the test fail, restore the fix.

### Bugs you find on the way

- **Related** — the task touches it, or it stands in the task's way: fix it in this change
  and name it in the review.
- **Unrelated** — file it now and carry on with the task. Do not fix it here.

  ```sh
  gh issue create --title "<symptom, plainly>" --body-file <file>
  ```

  The body gives the symptom, the repro, `file:line` where known, and where it was found
  (the branch). Never quote the maintainer. End it with `--SWTPCSim Claude`.

**A hazard is never documented as a warning.** If you are about to write "be careful to…",
fix the code instead, or file the issue.

## 4. Docs, before the review

The docs are part of the change under review, not a follow-up. Update whichever apply:

- `DESIGN.md`, when the design or its reasoning moved
- `docs/devguide/`, for how the code is built
- the manual in `docs/manual/` — and `docs/manual/ORDER` for a new chapter
- `docs/manual/ref/` is generated: edit the emitter and run
  `cmake --build build --target docs-reference`
- `docs/changelog/changelog.md`, its top section (the release not yet tagged) — **whenever what a package holder gets
  changes**. Not only code: a new document in the archive, an example that now ships, a chapter
  that answers something it did not, all count. The trap is filing a change as "only
  documentation" when the document IS the thing that shipped. A fix for a bug nobody reported
  still gets no entry. CI enforces this (the `Changelog entry` job in `ci.yml`), so a missing
  entry reds the PR rather than reaching a release unannounced.

Never commit a locally built PDF; CI builds them.

## 5. Test

The cadence `CLAUDE.md` sets: the unit suites for what you touched
(`./build/swtpc_tests <names>`), and `cmake -B build -DWERROR=on && cmake --build build -j`
for a code change. Run the full `ctest --test-dir build` for a wide change. **Quote
the pass line** (`100% tests passed out of N`); never paraphrase it.

## 6. STOP for review

Report, then wait:

- `git status --short` and `git diff --stat`
- what changed and why, file by file
- the tests run, with their pass lines
- the docs touched
- the issues filed, by number
- anything not verified, and why
- **last**, one line saying what is ready and where: *"Ready for your review on branch
  `<branch>`. Nothing is committed or pushed."* The maintainer reads to the bottom, so the
  line that says the next move is theirs goes there, not above the detail.

**Do not `git commit`. Do not push.** Changes the maintainer asks for go back to step 3, and
come back here for review again.
