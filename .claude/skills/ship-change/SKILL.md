description: How a reviewed swtpcsim change is shipped — commit after the maintainer approves, open the PR only after a second approval, poll CI, merge on green, then comment on the related issues. Use when told to commit, open the PR, push, ship or merge. Every step here waits for its own approval; work-task comes first.

# Ship a reviewed change: commit, PR, merge, issues

**Each gate is one explicit yes from the maintainer, for that step only.** An approval to
commit is not an approval to open a PR. If you are unsure whether you have one, you do not:
ask.

## 1. Commit — after the maintainer approves the review

**Before you stage: does this change what a package holder gets?** If the diff touches
`docs/manual/`, `docs/monitor/`, `docs/debugger/`, `examples/`, `docs/QUICK-START.md` or
`docs/package.map`, then `docs/changelog/changelog.md`'s top, unreleased section must already say what
someone can do now that they could not do in the last release. **A new document in the archive
and an example that now ships both count** — "it is only documentation" is how this gets missed,
and it has been. CI refuses the PR otherwise (the `Changelog entry` job); the way past it is a
real entry, or a `no changelog` label when a human decides one is not wanted.

- Stage exactly the files that were reviewed, by name. Never `git add -A` or `git add .`.
- The message follows the repo's style: `type(scope): summary`, then a body that says why.
- **No `Co-Authored-By`, no AI attribution, no quote of the maintainer.**
- **An issue it fixes: check who opened it first** (`gh issue view <N> --json author`).
  Opened by `deltecent` → `Fixes #N`, and the merge closes it. Opened by anyone else →
  `Refs #N`: `Fixes`, `Closes` and `Resolves` all close the issue on merge, and it is not ours
  to close.
- If more changes are wanted, go back to `work-task` step 3. Every new change is reviewed
  before it is committed.

## 2. Wait for approval to open the PR

Report the commits on the branch (`git log --oneline master..`) and stop. More commits may be
wanted first; each goes through review and step 1.

## 3. Open the PR — after approval

```sh
git push -u origin <branch>
gh pr create --base master --title "<type(scope): summary>" --body-file <file>
```

The body gives a summary, the verification done (pass lines), and for each related issue
`Fixes #N` if `deltecent` opened it or `Refs #N` if anyone else did — the same check as the
commit message. No attribution. Any comment you post on it ends with
`--SWTPCSim Claude`.

## 4. Poll CI every 20 seconds

```sh
gh pr checks <N>
```

Wait until all three platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) have finished.

- **Red:** stop and report the failing step and its log excerpt
  (`gh run view <id> --log-failed`). Never re-run a failure hoping it goes green — that hides
  a flake. Never merge. A fix for red CI is a new change: `work-task` step 3, review, commit
  approval.

## 5. Merge on green

No further approval is needed once all three are green.

```sh
gh pr merge <N> --merge --delete-branch
```

**Never `--auto`:** there is no branch protection, so it merges immediately, before CI.
Before merging, say so if the change leans on anything CI did not check — a platform not
tested by hand, a window check a person has not done.

## 6. After the merge

- **Comment on each related issue:** `Fixed by #<PR> (merged <sha>)`, or what is still left,
  signed `--SWTPCSim Claude` — on every related issue, whether or not the merge closed it.
  **Never close someone else's issue** — the person who opened it does. Only a `deltecent`
  issue closes, and only through `Fixes #N`. Write it to the `simplified-english` light rules.
- Sync: `git switch master && git pull --ff-only`.
- If `TODO.md` tracks the item, update it. It is untracked, so it needs no branch or PR.

## 7. Close out, so the session can be cleared

**The merge is not the end of the work — finish these before saying the task is done, so the
maintainer can `/clear` without losing anything.** Say explicitly when they are all done.

- **Wait for CI's PDF commit, then pull again.** If the change touched anything under `docs/`,
  the `Documents` workflow rebuilds `docs/*.pdf` and pushes a `Rebuild the PDFs for <sha>`
  commit to `master` a minute or two AFTER the merge. Poll it
  (`gh run list --workflow=docs.yml -L 1`), then `git pull --ff-only`. Skip this and the next
  session starts a branch on a stale `master` and rediscovers it as a conflict.
- **Confirm the branch is gone** both locally and on origin (`git fetch --prune`), and that
  `git status` is clean. A leftover branch or a stray edit is the thing a `/clear` hides.
- **Write back what was learned.** A non-obvious trace, a trap paid for once, or a procedure
  that is now a skill goes into a memory note (and its one-line pointer in `MEMORY.md`) — or
  into `docs/devguide/` when the fact is about how the code is built. Nothing durable should
  exist only in the transcript.
- **Report the final state in the reply**: the merge commit, the PDF commit if there was one,
  what was written back, and anything deliberately left undone.

## A PR from another contributor

If the PR's author is not `deltecent`, this skill does not apply: use `review-pr`. Its merge
needs green CI **and** the maintainer's approval.
