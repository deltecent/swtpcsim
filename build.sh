# WHAT THIS IS FOR. The README gives three commands; that is three too many for a first
# encounter. This script is the one command: it configures a Release build, builds it,
# and tells you where the binary landed and what it calls itself. If CMake is missing it
# says so in a sentence you can act on, rather than failing three lines deep in a configure.
#
# SDL3 STAYS OPTIONAL -- that is the project's loudest claim, and a plain `./build.sh`
# keeps it: it builds against a null display with nothing installed and every test passes.
# A window is the ONE thing that costs a dependency, so it is the ONE thing behind a flag.
# `--with-sdl` builds a private static SDL3 (tools/build-sdl3-static.sh) and links it, so
# the resulting binary carries its own SDL3 and asks nothing of the machine it runs on.
#
# Windows has its own: build.bat, a plain-PowerShell twin that needs no Developer shell.

SDL3 is optional: a plain build works with nothing installed. --with-sdl builds a
private static SDL3 (tools/build-sdl3-static.sh) once per machine and links it, so the
binary carries its own SDL3. On Windows, use build.bat instead.
