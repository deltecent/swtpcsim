// TnfsMedia -- a MediaFile that lives on a TNFS server (DESIGN.md 7.7).
//
// TNFS (The Network File System) is the FujiNet protocol: a small request/reply
// filesystem over UDP, port 16384 by default. This makes a disk or tape image on such
// a server mountable exactly like a local file --
//
//     MOUNT dcdd0:drive0 tnfs://myserver/games/cpm.dsk
//
// and every board gets it for free, because the whole difference from a local file is
// WHERE THE BYTES ARE. A TnfsMedia is a HostFile with a network under it: the image is
// slurped once at MOUNT into RAM, read/written there during emulation, and the dirty
// range is pushed back over TNFS at sync(). That is the same buffered, dirty-write-back
// model media.h documents, and it is what keeps the network OFF the emulation path --
// the guest never blocks on a datagram to read a sector, only (as with any medium) on
// sync, which for a disk is one small write per sector.
//
// SCOPE: slurp-sized single-file images (floppies, tapes, hard-sector, 88-HDSK). A
// multi-hundred-megabyte CF/SD card (the lazy CardImage model) is deliberately NOT
// served this way -- a network round trip per sector inside a bus cycle would stall
// emulated time. openHostMedia refuses those before they reach here.

// through this, which defaults to platform::connectUdp -- the real network. A test
// installs its own connector returning a fake UdpSocket that answers as a server would,
// so the whole protocol (mount, slurp, dirty write-back, retransmit, EAGAIN) is exercised
// with no real port, no thread, and nothing to flake. Pass nullptr to restore the default.
