// MediaFile -- the host file under any medium (DESIGN.md 7.3, 7.7).
//
// A disk and a tape have NOTHING in common as media: one is a geometry you can
// address at random, the other is a position on a strip that only moves forward.
// But as a HOST FILE they are the same thing, exactly: a byte range, a
// write-protect flag, and a sync. That is what this is -- and it is the only place
// in the program that opens one.
//
// So the layering is:
//
//     DiskImage / TapeImage      what the bytes MEAN   (the board's business)
//     MediaFile                  where the bytes ARE   (the host's business)
//
// A board holds a DiskImage or a TapeImage; it asks openMedia() for the file and
// never sees a file handle, a path grammar, or an ifstream. That is the same rule
// ByteStream enforces for serial lines, for the same reasons: cross-platform,
// scriptable, and testable with no filesystem in sight (MemoryMedia, below, is the
// ScriptedStream of the disk world).
//
// BUFFERED, WITH DIRTY WRITE-BACK. The whole image is read at MOUNT and written
// back at sync(). An 8 MB FDC+ image is 8 MB of RAM, and the machine it is
// emulating had 64K -- the asymmetry is not close enough to matter, and the
// alternative is a seek per sector.

    // the next mount decodes it back as trailing garbage. writeAt() may extend a
    // medium but has no way to end one.

    // bytes, and it means a crash mid-recording costs you nothing.
    //
    // It is not cheap for a medium that must RE-ENCODE ITSELF. An audio tape's file
    // bytes are a function of the whole byte stream, so a per-byte sync would
    // re-modulate the entire recording per byte and rewrite a multi-megabyte WAV
    // each time -- quadratic in both CPU and host I/O, on a path that today costs
    // nothing. So such a medium makes sync() a dirty mark and does the real work
    // here, at the points where the operator actually stopped the transport:
    // UNMOUNT, REWIND, and letting go of the RECORD button.
    //
    // It returns a bool and takes an `err` BECAUSE THE WORK CAN FAIL and a
    // destructor cannot report that -- the same reasoning that puts an explicit
    // sync() on the UNMOUNT path instead of leaving it to ~HostFile().

// sync() is void and, for a local file, it essentially never fails -- so this file

// that assumption: a server that goes away makes every per-sector sync() fail, and
// the operator, told nothing, keeps working while writes pile up unsent in RAM.
// That must not be silent -- it is the same rule that makes a forced read-only mount
// SAY SO (see readOnlyForced above).
//
// But a sync() failure has no board at its call site the way a MOUNT does (a disk
// board calls img->sync() per sector and throws the result away), so it cannot be
// narrated through Board::drainLog() the way forced-read-only is. This is the channel
// for it: a medium posts a line here, and Machine::drainBoardLog() drains it
// alongside the boards' own -- the same global-seam shape as setMediaResolver above,
// and idempotent to threading in the same way (the emulation loop and the monitor
// share a thread). Lines carry the medium's own name (the tnfs:// URL), so they
