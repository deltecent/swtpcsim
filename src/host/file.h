// `in:PATH` / `out:PATH` -- a host file as a ByteStream (DESIGN.md 7.1).
//
// The honest model of a paper-tape station: a READER that feeds a file into the
// line (a byte source) and a PUNCH that writes the line to a file (a byte sink).
// The two are physically independent -- separate files, separate positions -- and
// neither seeks, so DIRECTION IS THE KEYWORD, not an option:
//
//   in:PATH            a reader -- readable() true while bytes remain
//   out:PATH           a punch  -- writable() always, bytes land on disk
//   in:PATH,out:PATH   both, on a unit whose one line is bidirectional (a 4PIO
//                      section, a 2SIO channel)
//
// Putting the direction in the name is what keeps the eager-UART "one head"
// hazard (host/tape.h) away: a 6850 that reads whenever RDRF is clear can never
// disturb the punch, because the punch is a DIFFERENT FILE.
//
// PACING: the reader may carry its own clock -- `in:tape.tap?cps=300` is the
// 88-HSR (issue #152). That rides ByteStream::pacesItself() and the same wall
// clock the cassette uses (host/tape.h): a byte is not readable until its turn.
// nsPerByte == 0 is full speed, and then the wall is never consulted.
//
// 8-BIT CLEAN, like every line (host/filter.h): the files are opened BINARY, so a
// CR the guest sent stays a CR and nothing on the way to disk rewrites a byte.
//
// PROVENANCE, like a mount: describe() returns the exact spec the operator gave,
// so SHOW prints it and CONFIG SAVE round-trips it. A relative PATH is rebased
// against the board's config dir BEFORE the resolver ever sees it (the board is
// the only thing that knows its dir; see rebaseEndpointPaths in host/endpoint.*),
// and the board remembers the ORIGINAL spec, so this stream only ever echoes what
// it was handed.
