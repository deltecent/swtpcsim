// NullDisplay -- a Display that draws into memory and shows nothing (DESIGN.md 7.4:
// "A headless build must still pass every acceptance test").
//
// This is the display half of NullStream. It is what a graphics board is given
// when there is no window: in a headless CI build (no SDL, SWTPCSIM_ENABLE_SDL
// off), and in EVERY test, where tests/main.cpp injects it so a VDM-1 or Dazzler
// runs identically to the shipping binary and a test asserts on the pixels it
// paints -- with no window, no OS, and nothing to skip.
//
// ONE SURFACE PER OWNER, exactly as the SDL back end keeps one window per owner
// (issue #234): two video boards drawing into the same NullDisplay each get their
// own Surface, so a test can prove they no longer share one. It keeps each Surface
// it acquire()d (reusing it while the dimensions hold) so a test can read a board's
// last frame back after pumping it. present() and setPalette() record just enough
// to prove the board CALLED them -- present is a per-owner counter, the palette is
// retained per owner -- and do no host work.
