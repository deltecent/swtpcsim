// FilterStream -- the CONSOLE's transform chain (DESIGN.md 7.2).
//
// A ByteStream that wraps another ByteStream and mangles the bytes on the way
// through. THE CONSOLE OWNS ONE (host/console.h), and it is the only one on a LINE
// TO A DEVICE -- see the argument below for why a socket, a serial port or a tape
// must never get one.
//
// THE ONE CARVE-OUT is the console's STAND-IN under `--mcp`. When the AI drives the
// machine, the console is rebound to a headless `scripted` line (src/mcp/server.cpp)
// and the real Console -- transform chain and all -- is bypassed. That scripted line
// IS the console: it has the AI (and any mirror watcher) on the end of it, not a
// device, so it wants the SAME transforms the console owns. So the MCP console binding
// wraps its scripted line in a FilterStream seeded from Console::instance()'s settings
// (copySettingsFrom, below). This is not the forbidden case: it is a terminal's
// transforms on a terminal's stand-in, never a strip7out on a binary wire.
//
// AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS FILE ARGUED THE OPPOSITE, at some length: that the
// chain belonged on the LINE, inside every UART, so that `SET sio0 UPPER=ON`
// would work on a socket as well as on the console. It is a seductive argument
// and it is WRONG, because a line is not a terminal:
//
//   A card's connector goes to a modem, a socket, a paper-tape reader or a real
//   /dev/tty.usbserial, and the next thing down it is XMODEM -- 8-BIT BINARY. A
//   `strip7out` on that line masks bit 7 of every byte of the transfer and does
//   it SILENTLY. Set it once for MITS BASIC, forget, and every binary file that
//   ever leaves the machine is quietly corrupt.
//
// The 88-ACR reached this conclusion first and refused the chain outright -- "a
// tape is binary, not text" (tests/test_88acr.cpp) -- and every other endpoint
// deserves the same protection. So: socket, serial port, tape, file and loopback
// are 8-BIT CLEAN, ALWAYS. Only the console transforms, because only the console
// has a human on the end of it, and every one of these transforms is a fact about
// a TERMINAL.
//
// What a LINE has instead is LINE CODING -- baud, data bits, parity, stop bits.
// That is hardware (the 88-SIO's jumpers, the 6850's control register), it lives
// on the card, and on a real serial port it is programmed into the real port.
// A frame is not a filter.
//
// These settings are PROPERTIES, declared through the same Property layer as a
// board's -- so SET, SHOW, TOML, CONFIG SAVE, MCP and tab completion all pick them
// up with no code anywhere. There is one schema.
//
// DIRECTIONS, named from the GUEST's point of view, because the guest is who we
// are lying to:
//   inbound  = keyboard -> guest   (what the human typed)
//   outbound = guest -> screen     (what the program printed)
