// `ModemLine` -- a SOFTWARE-CONTROLLED phone line, as a ByteStream.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS IS NOT `TcpStream`. The socket streams in host/tcp.h model a line
// whose fate is fixed the moment CONNECT runs: `socket:2323` LISTENS and
// AUTO-ANSWERS -- the instant a client connects, carrier is up -- and
// `socket:host:port` DIALS once, at construction. That is exactly right for a
// telnet server or `CONNECT sio:a socket:...`, and it stays untouched.
//
// A real Bell 103 originate/answer modem (the PMMI MM-103) cannot be expressed
// that way, because the guest SOFTWARE decides at runtime whether to dial, to
// wait for a ring, or to sit on-hook -- and answering is a deliberate act, not
// something the transport does for it. So this stream:
//
//   * binds NOTHING in its constructor (a fresh ModemLine holds no sockets);
//   * plugs the phone line in -- and keeps it bound for the modem's life -- when
//     the board arms auto-answer -> armAnswer();
//   * dials out only when the board goes off-hook  -> dial();
//   * treats an inbound connection as a RING and does NOT raise carrier or
//     deliver a single byte until the board answers -> answer();
//   * hangs up the CALL on command, leaving the line plugged in -> hangup()
//     (goOnHook() is the DTR-low variant that spares a still-ringing caller).
//
// The board (Phase 2) drives all of that through the concrete MODEM CONTROL
// SURFACE below; it never touches a socket, exactly as DESIGN.md 7.1/7.7
// require. The stream reports LEVELS (ringing, carrier); the honoring card
// times the edges -- the pulsing RI bit the guest counts is synthesized in the
// board, not here.
