// HostDir -- the sandboxed host directory a guest program can reach (DESIGN.md
// 12.1).
//
// THE HOST BRIDGE IS THE ONLY CARD THAT LETS THE GUEST NAME A HOST FILE, and that
// makes it the only card that can be talked into opening the wrong one. So the
// naming, the rooting and the escape checks do NOT live on the board: they live
// here, in the host layer, where a board never sees a path and where the tests
// that matter can be written against the service alone.
//
// Same rule as MediaFile (host/media.h): a board asks for bytes and gets bytes. It
// does not hold a file handle, it does not know what a symlink is, and it cannot
// reach around this to std::filesystem.
//
// THE NAMESPACE IS FLAT, ON PURPOSE. No subdirectories, so a guest name is a
// FILENAME and never a path -- which deletes a whole class of escape bug rather
// than defending against it. This flatness is a documented limitation,
// and validateHostName() below is where that claim is actually enforced.
