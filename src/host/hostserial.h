// `serial:/dev/tty...` -- a REAL serial port, as a ByteStream (DESIGN.md 7.1).
//
// THE ONE ENDPOINT WHERE THE PINS ARE THE PINS. Everywhere else in the program a
// modem control line is a metaphor -- a socket's carrier is really a TCP session,
// a loopback's CTS is really its own RTS. Here DCD is DCD: a voltage on pin 8 of a
// DB-25, driven by whatever is actually on the other end of the cable, and the
// card believes it because there is nothing to disbelieve.
//
// WHAT A `wired` PIN READS WITH NOTHING ON THE FAR END (Patrick, 2026-07-12):
// FOLLOW THE HARDWARE. Report what the host UART's modem-status register actually
// says, whatever that is. We do not second-guess a real pin and we do not
// synthesize one -- if the far end is dead, the card sees a dead line, exactly as
// it would on the bench. (Every OTHER stream asserts everything, which is why a
// card strapped `cts=wired` onto the console still transmits.)

    // does not have. But a real driver's buffer DOES fill: at 300 baud it fills
    // almost at once. So the bytes the driver would not take are held here, drained
    // in pump(), and the queue's depth is what negates writable() -- which is what
    // holds TDRE clear, which is what makes the GUEST wait.
