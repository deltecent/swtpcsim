// RIFF/WAVE -- the container a cassette recording arrives in (DESIGN.md 7.3).
//
// THIS FILE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT TAPES. It reads a WAV into samples and writes
// samples back out; what the samples MEAN is tapemodem.h's business, and what the
// bytes mean after that is the board's. The same layering media.h draws between
// "where the bytes are" and "what the bytes mean", one level further down: a WAV is
// a container, an FSK signal is a modulation, and a program image is a program
// image. Three questions, three files.
//
// MONO FLOAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT LEAVES HERE. Every reader below converts to
// -1..1 float and averages the channels away, because the demodulator has no use for
// stereo and no use for a sample format -- it wants a waveform. Doing the conversion
// once, here, is what keeps the modem free of container trivia.
//
// AND IT MUST SURVIVE A REAL ARCHIVE FILE. The reason this is not thirty lines:
//
//   * CHUNKS ARE A LIST, NOT A LAYOUT. `fmt ` is not necessarily first and `data`
//     is not necessarily second. Archive WAVs routinely carry `LIST`/`INFO` (the
//     ripping tool's name), `fact`, or a cue chunk, and a reader that assumes the
//     textbook order fails on files that are perfectly valid. So: walk the list.
//
//   * ODD-LENGTH CHUNKS ARE PADDED, AND THE PAD IS NOT IN THE SIZE. Miss it and
//     every chunk after the first odd one is read at a one-byte offset -- which
//     does not fail, it just quietly returns garbage.
//
//   * WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE (0xFFFE) IS ORDINARY PCM WEARING A HAT. Anything
//     recorded by a modern tool may be tagged 0xFFFE with the real format in a
//     GUID's first two bytes. Refusing it would refuse files that are plain PCM.
//
// A REFUSAL IS ALWAYS SPECIFIC. Never a silent empty buffer: media.h's resolver
// contract is that a medium either opens or says why, and "this tape is empty" and
// "I do not read 32-bit float" must not look the same to the operator.
