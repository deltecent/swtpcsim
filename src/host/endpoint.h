// Endpoint resolution -- turning `console` or `socket:2323` into a ByteStream.
//
// THE DIVISION OF LABOR (DESIGN.md 7.7): the MONITOR opens the endpoint; the
// BOARD decides what the bytes mean. `CONNECT` and `MOUNT` are generic commands,
// not per-board ones, which is why a serial card written next year gets both for
// free without one line changing in the monitor.
//
// This is the seam. It is the only place in the program that knows the endpoint
// GRAMMAR, and no board is permitted to know it at all.

// is the only thing that knows its config dir). Grammar lives HERE, not in the
// board: only `in:PATH` / `out:PATH` name a path, and each is rewritten in place --
// `in:tape.tap?cps=300` keeps its options, `in:a,out:b` rebases both parts, and
// console/socket/serial/null pass through untouched. `describe()` still echoes the
// operator's ORIGINAL spec, so the board must remember that and rebase only the copy
// it hands the resolver, or a relative path double-rebases on CONFIG SAVE + reload.

// machine file connects a line (the first being the board's connect()), and without it a
// `[board.unit.a] connect = "in:tape.tap"` on a 6850/8251 card would resolve the file
// against the shell's cwd instead of the machine file's dir. Identity when `rebase` is
