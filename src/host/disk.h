// DiskImage -- the generic mountable disk (DESIGN.md 7.3).
//
// Every disk board (88-DCDD, Tarbell, 88-HDSK, Disk 1A, North Star, whatever you
// build next) sees only this. It does offsets and I/O, and NOTHING ELSE: what is
// inside a sector -- the sync byte, the header, where the checksum sits -- is the
// controller's business and never this file's.
//
// THE INTERFACE IS CHS, NOT LBA, AND THE FORMAT IS PER-TRACK-RANGE. Both are
// forced by disks that exist, and the reasoning is in DESIGN.md 7.3 -- it is not
// re-litigated here. In one line each:
//
//   - CHS, because every controller in the catalog addresses track/head/sector,
//     and an LBA interface would force each board to invent a flattening the
//     hardware never had and then invert it.
//   - Per track RANGE, because sector size and density vary WITHIN one image: a
//     double-density controller keeps track 0 single-density so the boot PROM can
//     read it. One geometry for the whole disk cannot say that; two initFormat()
//     calls can.
//   - startSector, because the 88-DCDD numbers sectors from 0 and most soft-sector
//     controllers number from 1. That is the off-by-one that silently corrupts a
//     disk, so it is a parameter, not a convention.
//
// Hard-sector vs soft-sector needs no flag: it falls out of sectorSize. A DCDD
// sector is 137 bytes because the image holds the WHOLE SLOT -- sync, header,
// payload, checksum, trailer. A Tarbell sector is 128 bytes because the header sat
// in the inter-sector gap on real media and never made it into the image.
//
// GEOMETRY PROBING IS THE BOARD'S JOB, NOT THIS FILE'S (DESIGN.md 7.3). 337,568
// bytes means a 77-track 8" floppy only because it is a DCDD; the same count on
// another controller means something else. The board probes, picks among the
// formats IT knows, and calls init()/initFormat(). See sizeMatches(), below --
// that much of the probe IS shared, because the trap is in the file format and not
// in the controller.

// 337,568 rounded up to the next block is exactly 337,664.
//
// So A STRICT `size == exact` PROBE REJECTS BOTH OF THE ONLY 8" DISKS WE HAVE.
// Every format match is `exact <= size < exact + 128`. The pad is never data, and
// a write never reaches it -- DiskImage bounds every access against the declared
// geometry, which stops at `exact`.

// ONE CLASS. NOT A BASE CLASS.
//
// DESIGN.md 7.3 used to name four implementations -- RawImageFile, ReadOnlyImage,
// MemoryDisk, and later ImdImage/Td0Image -- and every one of them has now
// dissolved:
//
//   - read-only was never a different IMAGE. It is a medium that says no.
//   - an in-memory disk was never a different image either. It is a MemoryMedia.
//   - and IMD/TD0 ARE STILL NEVER READ HERE: a raw sector-linear image is the only kind
//     THIS CLASS reads. An IMD that has to be used is converted to a raw sibling `.DSK`
//     FIRST -- at the MOUNT layer (src/cli/monitor.cpp + src/host/imd.cpp), not inside
//     the image -- and only the `.DSK` is ever wrapped here. (The convert used to happen
//     entirely outside the program; Patrick, 2026-08-01, moved it in-line at MOUNT, which
//     is the same bargain the WAV codec strikes: decode above MediaFile, so what DiskImage
//     sees is unchanged. TD0 is still nowhere.)
//
// So the image is sector-linear, ALWAYS, and this class is the whole of it -- which is
// what keeps readSector()/writeSector() non-virtual. They were virtual FOR a container
// format that carries its own per-track sector map, and DiskImage never gets one: the
// container is unpacked before it, so a virtual here would be a hook that is never pulled,
// and the next reader would have to work out why it is there.

    // streams it -- density from the controller, sector size and count and startSector from
    // the stream (boards/floppy-drive.cpp). So this is initFormat for exactly one (t,h): set
    // the slot's format, mark it valid (or not -- sectors==0 clears it), and re-run rebuild()
    // so the following tracks' offsets and the growth cap follow. It is safe to call after
    // init()/initFormat and after mount.
    //
    // CORRECTNESS RESTS ON THE ASCENDING-SLOT-ORDER INVARIANT. FORMAT writes slots 0->N in IMAGE
    // order (slotIndex), so when a track is (re)formatted to a LARGER geometry the slots after it
    // have either not been written yet or are about to be overwritten -- rebuild() moving their
    // offsets clobbers nothing valid. This is why the format program's write order must agree with

    // (cylinder-major) image wants both sides of a cylinder before the next -- and a real
    // controller's FORMAT does whichever its dumped images use (the VersaFloppy, cylinder-major).

    //
    //   - SOFT-SECTOR (Tarbell): the geometry arrives one track at a time from the Write
    //     Track command (setTrackFormat), so geometryBytes_ is DYNAMIC -- it grows as each
    //     track is formatted, and the cap rises with it under the ascending-order invariant.
