// Display -- the host video service a graphics board draws into (DESIGN.md 7.4).
//
// THE BOARD NEVER CALLS SDL. A VDM-1 or a Dazzler renders its picture into a
// Surface (an indexed-color pixel buffer) and hands it to present(); what turns
// that into a window, and how it scales, is the host's business and lives behind
// this interface. So the board compiles and RUNS with no graphics library at all
// -- against a NullDisplay (display_null.h) it renders into memory and a test
// reads the pixels back, which is exactly how a headless CI build proves the card.
//
// This is the display analogue of host/stream.h's ByteStream: the seam that keeps
// a board pure. A board's read()/write() are pure computation over state; anything
// that has to reach the outside world happens through an injected service, at a
// known point in emulated time (Board::pump(), DESIGN.md 7.1) -- never from inside
// a bus cycle, and never by owning the host's frame rate (DESIGN.md 7.4 #1: the
// SDL event loop does not own the main loop; the display is pumped once per slice).
//
// KEYSTROKES DO NOT GO INTO A BOARD FROM HERE. A display is output only. The
// VDM-1's keyboard is a SEPARATE parallel board that takes its bytes from a
// ByteStream/endpoint (host/endpoint.h), never from the window directly. But a
// windowed host DOES capture keystrokes when
// its window has focus, and those must reach the guest the same way the terminal's
// do: through the one Console (host/console.h), which is the recorded input queue
// (DESIGN.md 7.4). So a Display has an optional KEY SINK -- a callback the
// composition root points at Console::inject -- and the SDL window drains its key
// events into it. The board still reads only its ByteStream; window and terminal
// keys merge in the Console before any board sees them, so RECORD/REPLAY is intact.
