// CardImage -- a host IMAGE FILE plus a sidecar geometry descriptor, standing in for one
// CF/microSD card (reference/dual-sd-card.md; DESIGN.md 7.7 seam).
//
// The Dual SD board and its CF/SD cousins present a modern flash card to the S-100 bus as
// one contiguous run of 512-byte sectors -- potentially gigabytes of them. A HostFile slurps
// the whole medium into RAM at MOUNT (media.h): fine for an 8 MB floppy, a non-starter for a
// 1 GB card. And the raw file alone cannot say how big the card really is: a card is a fixed
// geometry, and a boot image is usually TRUNCATED to just its live filesystem -- the rest of
// the card is erased space the guest may still address.
//
// So a card is a raw image file, `foo.img`, paired with a SIDECAR descriptor of the same base
// name, `foo.geo`, that declares the card's true geometry:
//
//   foo.geo:
//     # a line comment
//     sector_size 512
//     sectors     769920      # the card's real size; the .img may be shorter
//
// The board sees one flat byte space [0, size()) = sectors * sector_size. This medium streams
// it with seek + read/write -- LAZY, one block at a time, the way the hardware does; no whole
// card is ever held in RAM. Keeping the geometry beside the image (rather than a per-directory
// descriptor) lets every card live as two files in one shared folder.
//
// GROWABLE, AND HONEST ABOUT AN ERASED CARD. The backing file may start empty or SHORT: blocks
// at or past its current end (but within the declared card) read the ERASED-CARD byte -- what a
// never-written CF/SD sector actually returns (0xFF), NOT the CP/M `0xE5` directory constant.
// This is a filesystem-agnostic block medium: it never synthesizes a CP/M structure. A blank
// card is genuinely UNFORMATTED, and the guest FORMATs it (the same model as the growable
// hard-sector disk, disk.h). A write grows the backing file up to the declared end; a write
// past that end -- i.e. past size() -- is refused. It is a fixed-geometry card: resize() is
// false.
//
// This is a MediaFile sibling of HostFile/MemoryMedia, paralleling DiskImage. It reaches the
// program through openHostMedia() (below), the resolver both mains install: a file WITH a
// sibling `.geo` becomes a CardImage; a `.img` file WITHOUT one is an error (a card needs its
// geometry); every other file falls through to a plain HostFile (floppies, tapes, ...).
