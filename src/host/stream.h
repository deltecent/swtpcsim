// ByteStream -- the generic serial endpoint (DESIGN.md 7.1).
//
// EVERY board that moves characters talks ONLY to this: the 88-2SIO, the 88-SIO,
// the ACR cassette, the line printer, the paper-tape reader, the PMMI modem. A
// board never opens a socket, never touches termios, never sees a file handle.
//
// That is not tidiness. It is the reason a board written next year is
// automatically cross-platform, automatically scriptable, and automatically
// replayable -- and the reason `CONNECT sio:a socket:2323` needs no code in the
// 2SIO at all. The board knows it has a serial line. It does not know, and must
// never learn, what is on the other end of it.
//
// DISCIPLINE: THE BOARD NEVER BLOCKS. It asks readable()/writable() and moves on.
// A UART that blocked would stop emulated time, and stopping emulated time to
// wait for a human is precisely how an emulator comes to drop characters.

// TRUE IS ALWAYS "ASSERTED", in both structs and on every stream. The pin-level
// inversions are real -- the 6850's are /DCD and /CTS, active low -- but they are
// a fact about THAT CHIP'S PINS, and they stay inside the chip that has them
// (mits-2sio.cpp). A stream that reported "carrier = true, meaning the pin is
// high, meaning there ISN'T one" would be exporting one chip's polarity to every
// other card in the machine, and the 88-SIO would be wrong for free.
//
// A console or a file has none of these in any real sense, so it ASSERTS them all
// -- which is exactly what strapping DCD and CTS to ground on the connector does,
// and what period installers did constantly. That is why there is still no "what
// if nothing is plugged in" branch anywhere in any board.

// WHAT THE CARD IS PROGRAMMED TO, WHICH IS WHAT IS ON THE WIRE (Patrick,
// 2026-07-12: "the real serial port is the limiting factor").

// There is exactly ONE line rate in a serial card and it is the UART's clock -- a
// jumper. The frame format is whatever the guest wrote into the control register.
// So when a unit is CONNECTed to a real host serial port, the CARD PROGRAMS THE
// PORT: `SET sio0:a BAUD=300` restraps the card and the host UART follows, and a
// guest that reconfigures the chip for 7E1 reconfigures the wire for 7E1, exactly
// as it would on the bench.
//
// The alternative -- a second, independent baud rate on the endpoint -- was in the
// plan and is now struck. It could only ever configure a MISMATCH, and a 6850
// strapped for 300 driving a terminal set to 9600 does not give you a fast link on
// real hardware. It gives you garbage.
