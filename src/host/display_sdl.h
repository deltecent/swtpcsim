// SdlDisplay -- the SDL3-backed Display (DESIGN.md 7.4). Compiled ONLY when SDL3 is
// found (SWTPCSIM_ENABLE_SDL); the headless build uses NullDisplay instead.
//
// THE ONLY FILE IN THE PROJECT THAT INCLUDES SDL. A board renders into a Surface
// (host/display.h) and knows nothing of this; the composition root (src/main.cpp)
// creates one of these, injects it, and the window appears. It converts the board's
// indexed frame to RGBA against the palette, uploads it to a streaming texture, and
// scales it nearest-neighbor with integer logical presentation so low-res pixels
// stay crisp on a modern panel.
//
// SINGLE-THREADED, MAIN-THREAD (DESIGN.md 7.4 #2). The emulation runs on the main
// thread; acquire()/present() are called from Board::pump() on that same thread, and
// pollEvents() from the run loop on the same one again, so SDL's window and event pump
// live on the main thread as macOS requires -- with no worker thread and no cross-thread
// queue. present() never blocks on vsync: emulated time, not the monitor's refresh, owns
// the clock. Input is drained by pollEvents(), not by present(), because a keystroke
// must not wait for a frame (host/display.h).

// SDL window per drawing board, keyed by the board's Owner handle -- acquire()/present()/
// setPalette() route to the caller's own Window. SDL_Init and the operator-focus policy stay
// one-of (one process, one keyboard, host/display.h); everything a window owns is per-board.
