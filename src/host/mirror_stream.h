// `ENDPOINT|socket:PORT` -- a live, BIDIRECTIONAL socket mirror of a serial line
// (issue #381). The tee's twin: same decorator shape, but the sink is a SOCKET, not a
// file, and it is a two-way wire -- a human telnets in, WATCHES the session the guest
// is having, and can TYPE, injecting keystrokes back onto the line (take-over).
//
// WHY IT IS NOT A `log=` TAP AND NOT A TeeStream. `log=` (host/console.cpp) is a
// SCREEN capture -- diagnostic, one-way, and it does not round-trip through CONFIG
// SAVE because it is not part of the wire. A TeeStream (host/tee_stream.h) is a
// protocol-analyzer file: one-way, formatted hex, on ANY line. This is neither: it is
// a second terminal on the same line, and the whole point is the reverse channel. So
// it is its own decorator -- built from the tee's structure (wrap inner_, forward
// everything) and the socket's I/O (host/tcp.cpp: accept in pump(), backpressure,
// carrier from the session), but keeping the two apart because they answer different
// questions.
//
// THE CLIENT NEVER PACES THE GUEST. This is the load-bearing rule. A watcher that
// fell behind -- a slow link, a paused terminal -- must NOT stall emulated time, or a
// human idly watching would freeze the AI driving the session. So the guest's flow
// control (writable/status/paces*) is the INNER line's, untouched; the client is a
// passive rider whose output queue is bounded and DROPPED-OLDEST when it overflows. A
// watcher loses scrollback, never the guest a byte. (Contrast host/tcp.cpp, where the
// socket IS the line and its backpressure legitimately negates CTS.)
//
// THE MIRROR ADDS NO ECHO -- the guest is the echo authority, exactly as on a real
// serial console. What the client sees is the guest's OUTPUT (every write, copied
// through); what the client TYPES is injected as INPUT the guest reads and -- if it
// echoes, as a monitor or CP/M does -- writes back, which the client then sees. So a
// command typed at the watcher appears once, its answer follows, and a password the
// guest does NOT echo stays unseen at the mirror too, faithfully. Echoing the read
// side here would double every character and leak the unechoed ones. (This is a
// deliberate reading of the plan's "faithful two-wire view": faithful to the TERMINAL
// the guest presents, which is what "watch and take over the console" means.)
//
// describe() ECHOES ITSELF -- `inner|socket:PORT[?ro]` -- so SHOW prints the mirror
// and CONFIG SAVE round-trips it (the `|` re-triggers the branch on reload, and a
// socket: right side selects the mirror over the tee). Same contract as the tee.
