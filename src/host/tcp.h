// `socket:2323` and `socket:host:port` -- a TCP session, as a ByteStream.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A CLIENT CONNECTING *IS* CARRIER APPEARING. This is the load-bearing mapping of
// the whole endpoint layer, and everything else falls out of it:
//
//   a telnet client connects    -> DCD rises
//   it closes the window        -> DCD falls, and the 6850 LATCHES that and
//                                  interrupts, exactly as it would for a modem
//   the guest drops DTR         -> we hang up on the client
//   the TCP send buffer fills   -> CTS falls, so TDRE stays clear, so the GUEST
//                                  waits rather than losing a byte
//
// That is what every terminal server ever built did, and it is what lets a PMMI
// modem card work over a socket without the board learning what TCP is. The board
// has a serial line with a modem on it. From where the card sits, that is not a
// lie -- it is *exactly* what it has.
