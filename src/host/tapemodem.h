// The cassette modem -- tones on one side, bytes on the other (DESIGN.md 7.3).
//
// A CARD DOES NOT APPEAR IN THIS FILE, AND MUST NOT. What a modem does is decided by
// four numbers and one flag (TapeFormat, below), not by which backplane it is
// plugged into. The 88-ACR and the Sol-20 differ here only as VALUES; a future card
// that records Kansas City tapes adds a TapeFormat constant and no code at all. That
// is the whole reason the codecs are named for the modulation and never for a card.
//
// TWO SCHEMES -- BUT ONLY THE TRANSMITTER CAN TELL THEM APART:
//
//   HOLD THE TONE FOR THE CELL. The transmitter emits one tone for the whole bit time and
//   lets the cycle fall where it may. The 88-ACR's continuous FSK is this (at 1850 Hz and
//   300 baud a cell is 6.17 cycles), and so is the Sol's 1200-baud CUTS -- there a mark
//   cell holds exactly one 1200 Hz cycle and a space cell a half cycle of 600 Hz
//   (Manchester-style), which is a nice fraction only by coincidence of the numbers.
//
//   KANSAS CITY (the Sol's 300-baud mode, and the ordinary microcomputer standard). A bit
//   is a WHOLE NUMBER of cycles -- the tones are 2:1 so that N cycles of the high tone and
//   N/2 of the low occupy the same time.
//
// `cycleCounted` therefore steers modulate() and NOT demodulate(). That is not a
// shortcut, it is what the signals are: in BOTH schemes the tone is simply held for
// the whole bit cell, so a receiver that measures which tone's energy fills each cell
// is correct for both. Kansas City's integer cycle counts make a transmitter's life
// tidy and buy the receiver nothing it did not already have. One demodulator, verified
// against real tapes in both modulations (see below).
//
// ---- THE RECEIVER CALIBRATES ITSELF, AND MUST --------------------------------------
//
// demodulate() does NOT assume the nominal markHz/spaceHz. It measures the two tones
// actually present and runs its matched filter at THOSE, because the nominal frequency
// is wrong on real media in three independent ways:
//
//   * WAVEFORM SHAPE CHANGES THE COUNT. A recovered cassette signal may be a sine or
//     a sawtooth (the MITS modem shapes its square waves into one deliberately). A
//     sine trips a threshold comparator twice per cycle and a sawtooth once -- a
//     factor of TWO in every interval, from nothing but the shape. Measured, not
//     assumed, this cancels: both tones scale together and the ratio is untouched.
//   * TAPE SPEED DRIFTS. A tape that plays 5% slow moves both tones 5%.
//   * A DUB MAY BE AT ANOTHER SPEED ENTIRELY, and archive files are dubs.
//
// Two-means over the log of the interval, seeded from the nominal ratio: it converges
// in a few passes, and it is the difference between a decoder that works on our own
// recordings and one that works on the tapes people actually have.
//
// ---- WHERE THE NUMBERS COME FROM -------------------------------------------------
//
// The 88-ACR's are documented: 2 MHz / 104 / 8 = 2404 Hz for a mark, 2 MHz / 135 / 8
// = 1852 Hz for a space, wired for 300 baud, idle line = mark = a steady 2400 Hz
// tone (reference/Altair 88-ACR Cassette Interface.md, sections 6 and 7). The
// demodulator's PLL sits at 2125 Hz -- halfway -- and tolerates about +/-100 Hz.
//
// The Sol's CUTS cycle counts ARE in a manual: Processor Technology's CUTS Assembly and
// Test Instructions (1977), distilled in reference/CUTS Assembly and Test.md and
// corroborated by H. Holden's 2018 teardown of the Sol-PC modem. At its 1200-baud default
// a mark is ONE cycle of 1200 Hz and a space a HALF cycle of 600 Hz -- an octave below
// Kansas City, whose 2400/1200 Hz tones the Sol uses only in its 300-baud (SE TA 1) mode.
// Framing is 8N2 (one start, eight data, TWO stop). deramp.com's TRK80.WAV agrees with the
// manual and decodes to a valid SOLOS header ("TRK80", SIZE 0x1EA0) whose length matches
// the payload -- the oracle that makes it a fact. See reference/Sol-20.md.
//
// ---- A CARD DECLARES WHAT ITS OWN MODEM CAN HEAR, AND REFUSES THE REST -------------
//
// A board does NOT trial-decode its way through this list looking for something that
// sticks. It names the format(s) the physical hardware demodulates, and a tape in any
// other modulation is REFUSED -- with a message saying what the tape actually is.
//
// Because the alternative is inventing hardware. Not all published Altair cassette
// audio is in the 88-ACR's format: the "2SIO as Cassette" tapes measure 2397/1852 (the
// MITS modem, confirming the manual's arithmetic off real media), but the "KCS" and
// "KCACR" -- Kansas City ACR -- tapes measure 2377/1201, and those are a DIFFERENT
// STANDARD, not ACR tapes recorded oddly. ("2SIO as cassette" names which serial card
// the loader talks to; the modem, and so the audio, is unchanged.)
//
// The 88-ACR physically cannot read the Kansas City ones, and its manual says why: the
// demodulator is a PLL centred at 2125 Hz that accommodates about +/-100 Hz of tape
// drift. A 1200 Hz space tone is some 925 Hz outside that. A real card fed such a tape
// does not read it badly -- it reads nothing. A simulator that decoded it anyway would
// be handing the guest data no 88-ACR could ever have produced, which is the exact
// failure DESIGN.md forbids.
//
// The Sol-20 is a genuinely different case and gets two formats HONESTLY: its CUTS
// UART really does run at 300 or 1200 baud, and the GUEST picks which at OUT FAh D5.
// That is a switch on the hardware, not a guess by the host.

// that opened on the start bit itself would lose its first byte and one that ended on
// the last stop bit would lose its last. Zero is a legitimate request -- it means trim
// the file to its data -- and it must not quietly mean "and lose a byte".
//
// BOTH ARE TONE, NOT SILENCE, and that is measured rather than assumed: the UART's
// output pin idles high, high is mark, and the modem board has no squelch and no
// carrier-off -- its oscillator runs whenever the card is powered. So a card
// recording nothing lays down continuous mark. Blank tape and idle tape are
// acoustically different things. (reference/Altair 88-ACR Cassette Interface.md,
// "What idle tape carries, and where the leader really lives".)
//
// THE DURATIONS MUST BE SYNTHESIZED, because they cannot be recovered. A byte image
// holds no time -- verified on the corpus: nothing on those tapes is encoded as
// duration, the longest interior run of mark being one all-ones frame. So the leader
// a loader needs in BYTES survives a round trip through .TAP, and the leader the
// TRANSPORT needs in SECONDS does not exist until something puts it back. That is
// this argument's job, and it is why the callers make it a property rather than a
// constant: 15 s is what the MITS manual asks for and 3 s is what a real Sol dub
// carries, and neither is a fact about the modulation.
// `level` is the peak amplitude as a fraction of full scale (0..1) -- the recorder's
// output-level knob. The default is 0.36, the peak of the one genuine Sol dub we hold
// (TRK80.WAV): our old 0.8 overdrove a real Sol's front-end AGC. `rcHz` is the corner of
// the one-pole low-pass that rounds a flip-flop's square edges the way the modem's RC
// network and a cassette's bandwidth do; it only applies to a `gridToggled` format
// (host/tapemodem.h). Its default (4000 Hz) reproduces the genuine dub's curvature -- the
// fraction of the tone spent near its peak, ~72%, and the crest factor ~1.13 -- rather than
// leaving a flip-flop's flat tops. (The dub is not literally a filtered square: it also
// carries a strong 3rd harmonic, which pulls the other way, so no one corner matches both
// its curvature and its harmonics; a real Sol reads by crossing timing, which every corner
// here gets right, so the corner is chosen to look like the dub.) Both are deck properties.
