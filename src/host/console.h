// Console -- the host keyboard and screen, as a ByteStream (DESIGN.md 7.2).
//
// It is a ByteStream like any other, so the 2SIO connecting to it needs not one
// line of console-specific code. But it is the only stream with a HUMAN on the
// far end, and that costs it two things nothing else needs:
//
// 1. RAW MODE. The tty driver must stop editing lines, stop echoing, and stop
//    turning Ctrl-C into a signal -- because the GUEST wants those bytes. A CP/M
//    program that reads Ctrl-C to abort cannot see it if the driver ate it.
//
// 2. THE ATTN KEY -- and this one is NON-NEGOTIABLE (DESIGN.md 7.2). Once the
//    guest owns the keyboard, it owns ALL of it, including every key you might
//    have wanted to use to get out. A guest in a tight input loop -- which is
//    every monitor, every BASIC, every CP/M prompt ever written -- would trap you
//    with no way back to the simulator short of killing the process.
//
//    So ATTN (default Ctrl-E) is intercepted HERE, by the host, before the guest
//    is ever offered the byte. The guest cannot disable it because the guest
//    never sees it. That is the whole design: it is a key on the FRONT PANEL, not
//    a key on the terminal.
//
// THERE IS EXACTLY ONE OF THESE, because there is exactly one keyboard. Two
// boards both reading it would each get half the characters, which is not a
// hypothetical -- it is what happens the moment a machine has two 2SIOs and you
// forget. Hence `Console::instance()` and the monitor's arbitration: connecting a
// second unit to the console STEALS it, and says who from.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE KEYBOARD BUFFER (Patrick, 2026-07-12)
//
// The HOST owns the keyboard, not the board. Keys go into a buffer here, and a
// card that wants a character takes one from it. It is the arrangement AltairZ80
// uses, and it buys three things that all matter:
//
//   1. ATTN IS WATCHED WHETHER OR NOT ANYBODY IS READING. `poll()` runs every
//      slice of a RUN, so the key works while the guest is busy computing, while
//      it is spinning on a disk, and -- the case that broke the first version of
//      this -- while there is no console board in the machine at all.
//
//   2. BYTES CAN BE INJECTED. `inject()` puts characters in the buffer as though
//      they were typed, and no board can tell the difference, because at the level
//      the board sees there IS no difference. That is what MCP's send/expect and a
//      scripted boot are made of, and it costs nothing here.
//
//   3. NO LATCH TO JAM. The old design peeked ONE byte and held it for a guest to
//      collect. With no guest, the latch stayed full, the poll stopped looking, and
//      ATTN went dead exactly when you most needed it.
//
// The buffer is the HOST's, not the card's -- so it does not make the UART any
// less real. The 6850 still holds exactly one character in RDR, still sets RDRF
// when it does, and still takes the next byte only when the guest has cleared it.
// The buffer is the line, and a line is buffered and flow-controlled (DESIGN.md
// 7.1). It is a real keyboard buffer, so it is FINITE: type past the end and the
// keys are dropped, as they are on any terminal that ever beeped at you.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// ATTN IS TRACKED ON CONSOLE INPUT AND NOWHERE ELSE (Patrick, 2026-07-12).
//
// It lives in this class, and this class is the host's keyboard. A unit connected
// to a socket, a serial port, or a loopback IS NOT THE CONSOLE, and its data goes
// through UNALTERED -- 0x05 down a socket is a byte of somebody's protocol, and
// scanning a modem line for a key that only exists on the operator's terminal
// would be a corruption of the data, not a feature.
//
// So: nothing outside this file may look for ATTN. Not FilterStream, not the
// 2SIO, not the endpoint layer. If you find yourself adding it there, the answer
// is no.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE TRANSFORM CHAIN IS THE CONSOLE'S, AND ONLY THE CONSOLE'S (Patrick,
// 2026-07-13). DESIGN.md 7.2 always said so; a previous version of this code
// moved the chain onto the LINE -- a FilterStream inside each UART, wrapping
// whatever the unit was connected to -- so that `SET sio0 UPPER=ON` would work
// on a socket too. THAT WAS WRONG, and it was wrong in a way that corrupts data.
//
// A line is not a terminal. The 88-SIO's line goes to a modem, a socket, a
// paper-tape reader or /dev/tty.usbserial, and the next thing down it is XMODEM,
// which is 8-BIT BINARY. A transform on the line masks bit 7 of every block of
// that transfer and does it SILENTLY. The 88-ACR already knew this and refused
// the chain outright ("a tape is binary, not text", tests/test_88acr.cpp) -- the
// same argument holds for every endpoint that is not a human.
//
// So the ONLY place a byte may be altered is here, where there is a human and a
// screen, and the alteration is a fact about the TERMINAL. Everything else --
// socket, serial port, tape, file, loopback -- is 8-BIT CLEAN, ALWAYS.
//
// What a line DOES have is LINE CODING -- baud, data bits, parity, stop bits.
// That is real, it is hardware (the 88-SIO's jumpers, the 6850's control
// register), and it belongs to the card. It sets how long a character occupies
// the wire, and on a REAL serial port it is programmed into the real port
// (ByteStream::setParams). It is a FRAME, and it is never a filter: a card
// strapped for 7 data bits sends seven, because that is what the hardware does.
