// TerminalStream -- the generic built-in terminal as a ByteStream endpoint (issue #244).
//
// This is what `connect = "terminal"` resolves to. It is the terminal engine
// (host/terminal/) wearing a ByteStream face: the guest's output (write()) is fed to a
// TerminalEmulator that drives a TerminalScreen, which a TerminalRenderer paints into the
// host Display every pump(); the guest's input (read()) is drained from the emulator's
// reply FIFO -- the cursor reports it owes and the host keystrokes routed to this line.
//
// So every serial board gets a windowed terminal for free, exactly as printing did: no
// board learns what a terminal is, only that it has a line (DESIGN.md 7.1, 7.7). The
// window is the SIMULATOR's, so the emulation is the same on every platform and answers
// the period reports (ESC[6n) an external xterm would answer with its own geometry.
//
// THE DISPLAY AND FONT ARE INJECTED ONCE, at the composition root (setDisplay/setFont),
// the same way the boards' Display and the endpoint resolver are -- a stream constructed
// deep inside resolveEndpoint cannot be handed them, and they are session-lifetime host
// resources it only borrows. In a headless build (or a test) the display is a NullDisplay,
// which answers isWindowed() false; resolveEndpoint refuses `terminal:` there rather than
// opening a serial line nobody can see (see hasWindow()).
//
// KEYBOARD ROUTING IS NOT HERE YET. Today the one host window feeds the single Console
// (src/main.cpp); wiring each terminal window's keys to ITS line is the multi-window work
// (issue #244, Task 4). keyAscii()/keySpecial() are the seam that work will drive; until
// then a `terminal:` line renders the guest and answers its reports, and read() carries
// only those reports.

    // terminal with a HUMAN on the end -- the one case that comment names where these
    // transforms are facts about a terminal. So the console's chain lives here too, as
    // the `[terminal]` config section, applied by this stream at its own byte seams.

    // It exists because an even-parity monitor (PS II) writes parity into bit 7: CR
    // 0x0D goes out as 0x8D, which is >= 0x20 and prints as a glyph instead of homing
    // the cursor, so Enter line-feeds without a carriage return. `strip7out` masks it.
