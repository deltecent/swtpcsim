// TerminalEmulator -- the DIALECT half of a terminal: a state machine that turns an
// incoming byte stream into operations on a TerminalScreen (host/terminal/screen.h).
//
// This is where terminals differ. The SD Systems VDB-8024 answers its v1.6 firmware's
// control codes (SdVdb16Emulator, src/boards/sd-vdb8024.cpp); a VT100, an ADM-3A, a
// VT52 and a Heath/Zenith H19 each answer their own -- and each will be a subclass here
// (issue #244). The screen and the renderer are shared; only this changes.
//
// feed() takes ONE display byte and applies its effect to the screen. reset() returns
// the parser to its ground state (a mid-sequence ESC is abandoned), as an S-100 RESET
// or a power cycle does.
//
// AND IT REPLIES. A terminal is bidirectional: some sequences ask a question the guest
// reads back (a VT100's ESC[6n cursor-position report), and a host keystroke turns into
// the guest's own byte sequence (an arrow key is ESC[A on a VT100, ESC A on a VT52,
// Ctrl-K on an ADM-3A). Both are bytes flowing TOWARD the guest, so both land in one
// FIFO -- the reply buffer -- which whoever holds the terminal (the TerminalStream, an
// endpoint) drains with takeReply() and hands to the UART's receive path. feed() enqueues
// a report; keyAscii()/keySpecial() enqueue a keystroke; the guest cannot tell them apart,
// which is exactly right -- to a UART they are all just characters arriving on the line.
