// TapeImage -- the sequential counterpart of DiskImage (the 88-ACR's .TAP).
//
// A cassette has exactly one thing a disk does not: A POSITION. It is not that a
// tape is a worse disk -- it is that the head is where it is, and the only way to
// get to the start of the program is to REWIND. That is the entire difference, and
// it is why this is its own class and not a DiskImage with one track.
//
// So the CLI gets a verb (`REW acr0:tape`), SHOW gets a number, and the guest gets
// bytes in the order they were recorded.
//
// AND THEN THE ADAPTER: a tape IS a ByteStream. TapeStream, below, is the whole of
// what makes the 88-ACR nearly free -- the shared 1602 UART hands its bytes to a
// stream, and it never learns whether the stream is a socket, a terminal, or a
// cassette turning at 300 baud. That is DESIGN.md 7.1's promise being cashed: the
// board knows it has a serial line, and does not know what is on the end of it.

//
// NON-OWNING, and on purpose: the BOARD owns the TapeImage, because REWIND and
// SHOW are the board's business and the UART must not be able to reach either. The
// chip gets this, and this can only move bytes.
//
// readable() is `there is more tape`, which is the ByteStream contract kept
// exactly: the stream HOLDS the byte until the card takes it. A tape that dropped
// a byte because the guest was slow would be manufacturing data loss the host does
// not have -- the very thing DESIGN.md 7.1 forbids. A real recorder does drop
// data, and we do not model that. It is in the board's .md, under Limitations.
//
// ---- AND IT IS IN EXACTLY ONE MODE AT A TIME, BECAUSE THE TAPE IS ------------
//
// PLAY or RECORD. Not both. This is not a simplification, it is the machine: the
// 88-ACR has NO MOTOR CONTROL -- there is no register for it, the guest cannot
// reach the transport, and the operator worked the controls with their finger. One
// head, one transport, one direction of signal flow: a deck that is recording is
// not handing you back what used to be on the tape.
//
// NOT because "one button is down at a time" -- on a real recorder you hold PLAY
// and RECORD together, and RECORD alone does nothing. That is one action selecting
// one mode, and the mode is what excludes.
//
// AND WITHOUT IT, RECORDING SILENTLY CORRUPTS THE TAPE. There is ONE head and so
// ONE position (see pos_ above -- read and write share it, as they must). The UART
// receives EAGERLY: it pulls a byte off its line the moment it has room, because
// that is how DAV and an interrupt-driven loader work. So a tape mounted for
// writing would have its first byte read away by the card before the guest ever
// ran, the position would sit at 1, and the guest's recording would begin at byte
// ONE. Off by one, on every tape, in the direction nobody checks.
//
// The mode makes that unrepresentable rather than merely unlikely: in PLAY the
// stream is not writable, in RECORD it is not readable, and so nothing can advance
// the head except the thing the operator asked for.
