// `printer:QUEUE[?key=value&...]` -- a host print queue as a write-only ByteStream
// (DESIGN.md 7.1, 7.7; docs/printing.md; issue #70).
//
// A printer is something on the far end of a line, so it is a ByteStream and not a
// property of the printer card -- exactly like out: and serial:. The 88-C700 works
// the day this lands, and every other card that can put a byte on a line (the future
// 88-LPC, the Sol-20 printer unit, a serial printer on the 2SIO) works later with no
// board changed. The grammar lives in resolveEndpoint (host/endpoint.cpp), the one
// place allowed to know it; this class is handed the parsed pieces.
//
// THE HARD PART IS WHERE ONE JOB ENDS. Centronics has no end-of-job signal and
// neither does a serial line: the guest writes bytes and then stops, and stopping is
// not an event. A host print queue wants a finite job handed over once, so something
// must decide the boundary. This stream buffers the bytes and closes the buffer into
// one job at a boundary, whichever fires first:
//
//   * an IDLE TIMER on WALL seconds -- every byte restarts it; expiry submits. This
//     is the usual boundary, matching what a guest does (print a report, go back to
//     the user). It runs on host time, NOT the emulated Clock: the default clock is
//     free-running, so an emulated timeout could fire in 80ms or never, and nothing
//     here is guest-readable. Same rule that moved the VDM-1 blink off the Clock.
//   * a FORM FEED (0x0C), optionally -- the closest the era had to "page done". Off
//     by default: a multi-page report is one job, and splitting it makes N jobs that
//     interleave with everyone else's on a shared queue.
//   * a BYTE CEILING (max), so a runaway loop cannot eat memory.
//   * teardown: the DESTRUCTOR submits any open job, which is the ONE boundary every
//     lifecycle path reaches -- DISCONNECT (the board swaps in a NullStream and this
//     is destroyed), CONFIG LOAD (the machine is replaced wholesale), and exit. The
//     idle timer stops when the guest stops (pump() is only called from the run
//     loop), so the destructor is the safety net, the MediaFile::commit() precedent.
//
// AN EMPTY BUFFER NEVER SUBMITS. A form feed closes the job and the idle timer then
// expires with nothing in hand; if that submitted, every printout would be followed
// by a blank job -- silent, and diagnosed only by someone at the printer counting
// blank pages. Every boundary checks there is something to send.
//
// flush() IS A NO-OP, DELIBERATELY. ByteStream::flush() means "push what you are
// holding" and the C700 calls it on EVERY pump (mits-88c700.cpp), so if it submitted
// a job every idle slice would submit an empty one. The job boundary is its own
// thing (submitIfPending), and it does not ride on flush().
//
// 8-BIT CLEAN, like every line. A printer control language needs the high bit and
// its own control codes; the bytes buffered are the bytes the guest sent, and the
// bytes submitted are those. Whether a printer line wants CR/LF translation of its
// own is a separate question with its own answer, not the console's transforms.
