// and must never stall emulated time. A TNFS medium is the opposite case -- it does
// ALL of its network I/O at MOUNT and at sync(), never inside the emulation loop, and
// each step is a strict request/reply that has no meaning until the reply is in hand.
// A blocking send() + a recv() with a timeout is exactly that shape, and expressing it
// with the non-blocking primitive would be a poll-spin reinventing the timeout the
// kernel already has. So this is a separate, deliberately simpler thing.

// the source check a session bound to one server wants anyway.
