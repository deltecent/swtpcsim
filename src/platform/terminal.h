// The host terminal -- raw mode, and the bytes that come through it (DESIGN.md 2.1).
//
// This is the third and last thing in the project that had an OS underneath it. The
// serial port and the socket moved into src/platform/ when they were built; the
// terminal was already here, and it had been sitting in src/cli/lineedit.cpp and
// src/host/console.cpp since the beginning, with a preprocessor conditional in one of
// them and a bare #include <termios.h> in the other.
//
// THE CONTRACT (2.1): pure declarations, zero conditionals, and NO OS TYPE IN ANY
// SIGNATURE -- no termios, no HANDLE, no file descriptor. A caller of this header
// cannot tell what it is running on, and that is the whole point: the OS layer is only
// sealed if the seal is airtight.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE TERMINAL HAS EXACTLY TWO CLAIMANTS, AND THEY WANT OPPOSITE THINGS FROM IT.
//
// The MONITOR wants a line editor: no echo and no line discipline, because it draws
// and edits the line itself -- but Ctrl-C must still SIGNAL, because at a monitor
// prompt Ctrl-C is a way out, not data.
//
// The GUEST wants everything: Ctrl-C is a byte a CP/M program is entitled to read, and
// so is Ctrl-S, and so is every other control character the driver would otherwise have
// an opinion about. And its reads may NEVER WAIT, because a blocking read stops
// emulated time dead.
//
// Two modes, then, and no third. Anything that thinks it needs a third should look
// again at which of these two it actually is.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Is there a human out there at all? False under a pipe, a script, and the test suite,

    // The MONITOR's line editor (src/cli/lineedit.h says why we edit the line ourselves

    // the operator types.

// FALSE IS NOT A FAILURE. It means stdin is a pipe, a file, or a script -- there is no
// terminal state to change, and none needs changing. Guest mode still arranges for
// reads not to wait (a pipe with no data yet WOULD block, and that is the case that
// matters), so `swtpcsim -s script.cmd` drives a guest with no tty at all.
//
// NESTING IS THE CALLER'S BUSINESS -- this is a set, not a stack. But what gets saved
// is the state the terminal was in before ANY of this started, so restoreTerm() always
// gives back what the operator's shell handed us, never some intermediate raw mode.

// nothing was ever taken.

// IT ALSO RUNS IF WE ARE KILLED, OR IF WE CRASH. The implementation restores before
// letting the signal do its work -- on the termination signals (SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP,
// SIGQUIT) and on the crash/panic signals (SIGABRT from an internal std::abort(), plus
// SIGSEGV/SIGBUS/SIGFPE) -- and via atexit() on any std::exit() path a destructor would
// miss. Because a simulator that leaves your shell with no echo when it dies is a
// simulator you run exactly once, and C++ destructors do not run when a signal terminates
// the process. SIGKILL alone cannot be caught, so it is the one way out beyond reach.

// The bytes.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Read what is there, NEVER waiting. THREE ANSWERS, and a correct caller tells all
// three apart:
//
//     returns > 0             bytes -- this many of them
//     returns 0, eof false    NOTHING RIGHT NOW. A quiet line. Ask again later.
//     returns 0, eof true     THE INPUT HAS ENDED, and there will never be another
//                             byte. Only a pipe ever says this. A terminal never does.
//
// Conflating the last two is the classic bug, and it breaks in both directions: read
// EOF as "quiet" and a scripted run never finishes, read "quiet" as EOF and it stops
// the instant the writer pauses to think.
//
// AND THE OS DOES NOT HAND YOU THE DIFFERENCE. An implementation must not take a
// zero-length read for the third answer on its own: a tty in Guest mode is VMIN=0, and
// on macOS/BSD an empty read of one returns 0 -- the same number a hung-up pipe returns.
// Issue #25 is what believing it costs. Which answer a 0 is depends on what stdin IS.

// and waiting is exactly what it wants.
int readInputBlocking();

// Wait up to timeoutMs for stdin to have a byte ready, WITHOUT reading it. THREE
// answers, the same three shapes readInput has:
//
//     Ready      a byte is waiting -- readInputBlocking() will return it at once.
//     Timeout    nothing yet. The caller may do periodic work and ask again.
//     Ended      the input has ENDED (a pipe/file, never a terminal). No more bytes.
//
// This is what lets the MONITOR'S line editor keep the video window alive while parked
// at the prompt: wait a short while, and on a Timeout pump the host (SDL events) and ask
// again, instead of sleeping in a bare read() that services nothing (DESIGN.md 7.4).
// Only the OUTER first-byte wait needs this; an escape sequence's bytes arrive together.
