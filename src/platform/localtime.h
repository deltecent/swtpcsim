// Broken-down LOCAL time, done thread-safely (DESIGN.md 2.1: the interface carries no
// OS type, and there is one implementation file per OS).
//
// This exists because plain std::localtime() writes into a shared static buffer -- a
// data race the instant two threads ask the clock -- and the reentrant spelling is the
// ONE thing that differs between hosts: POSIX has localtime_r(&t, &tm), MSVC has
// localtime_s(&tm, &t) (and treats the plain call as the deprecation error C4996 that
// this project treats as a build failure). That single difference is exactly what the
// platform layer is for: a signature with no OS type, and one small file per OS behind it.
//
// The Host Bridge's HDIR listing formats a host file's mtime with this; there is no
// timezone database dependency, just the host's own idea of local time.

// A calendar date and time in the HOST's local zone. Fields are the human ones, already
