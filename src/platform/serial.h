//
// A real serial port on the host (DESIGN.md 2.1, 7.1).
//
// THE CONTRACT. Pure declarations, zero conditionals, no OS type anywhere in the
// signature -- no `int fd`, no `HANDLE`. That is the rule that makes 2.1 hold:
// the moment an OS type appears in an interface, every caller needs an #ifdef to
// name it, and you are SIMH again.
//
// One implementation file per OS, chosen by CMake:
//   src/platform/posix/serial_posix.cpp   -- termios, TIOCMGET/TIOCMSET
//   src/platform/win32/serial_win32.cpp   -- SetCommState, GetCommModemStatus
//
// NON-BLOCKING, ALWAYS, AND THAT IS NOT AN OPTION. A board asks readable() and
// moves on (7.1); a read that waited for a byte would stop emulated time to wait
// for a human. read() returning 0 is a quiet line, not an error and not an EOF.
//
// THERE IS NO THREAD BEHIND THIS. 7.5 permits one, and we do not need one: a
// serial port is a file descriptor that can be asked, without waiting, whether it
// has anything. A thread would buy nothing and would cost the determinism that
// RECORD/REPLAY is built on -- the bytes would arrive at whatever cycle the host
// scheduler felt like. They arrive in pump(), at a known point in emulated time.

// There is exactly ONE line rate in an 88-2SIO and it is the 6850's clock -- a
// jumper on the card. The frame format is whatever the guest wrote into the
// control register, because those bits ARE what goes on the wire. So this struct
// is filled in from the chip, not from a property: `SET sio0:a BAUD=300` restraps
// the card, and the host UART follows it.
//
// A card strapped for 300 talking to a terminal set to 9600 does not give you a
// fast link on real hardware. It gives you garbage. There is no second baud rate
// to configure, and inventing one would only let you configure the garbage.

    // the OS DRIVER owns RTS and CTS -- and on this card the 6850 owns them: RTS is
    // control-register bits 5-6, and CTS gates TDRE (MC6850 data sheet, and see
    // mits-2sio.cpp). Two owners of one pin is not a feature, it is a bug that only
    // shows up under load. The port is opened with flow control OFF and the chip
    // drives the pins itself, which is the only arrangement in which `SET sio0:a
    // cts=wired` can mean anything at all.
