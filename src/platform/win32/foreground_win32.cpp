// The Windows half of platform/foreground.h.

// Windows has no application-level activation policy to restore: a window shown with
// SDL's SDL_WINDOW_ACTIVATE_WHEN_SHOWN hint set to "0" comes up without taking focus,
// and clicking it activates it, which is the behavior we are after. Nothing to do.

#include "platform/foreground.h"

namespace swtpc::platform {

void allowForegroundActivation() {}

// Nor is there an application to deactivate: activation on Windows is per-window, and
// a process cannot politely hand the foreground to "whoever had it before" -- the calls
// that move it (SetForegroundWindow and kin) name a window and are deliberately
// restricted. Leaving focus where the user put it is the right answer here.
void yieldForeground() {}
