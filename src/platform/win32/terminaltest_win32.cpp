// THE TERMINAL LAYER, ON A REAL CONSOLE.
//
// The PIPE path of terminal.h is proven in CI every build: acceptance-basic4k/8k feed a
// live guest keystrokes on a redirected stdin, so readInput()'s PeekNamedPipe branch,
// its never-waiting contract and its broken-pipe EOF (which stops the run with
// InputEnded) all run there. What a piped test cannot reach is the CONSOLE path -- a
// real interactive terminal, which a pipe by definition is not -- and this proves it:
// enterTermMode() reconfiguring a real console into the two raw modes the header
// describes, and restoreTerm() giving it back byte-for-byte.
//
// WHY IT LIVES IN src/platform/win32/ AND NOT tests/. It reads and asserts on
// SetConsoleMode / GetConsoleMode, which are Win32 calls, and DESIGN.md 2.1 keeps OS
// calls in the platform layer. A test of OS-specific code is OS-specific code, so it
// sits beside the file it tests. The POSIX terminal has its own mirror of this file,
// src/platform/posix/terminaltest_posix.cpp, for the same reason.
//
// WHAT IT DELIBERATELY LEAVES TO A HUMAN. terminal_win32.cpp's #1 flagged risk is
// readInput()'s peek-and-discard loop over the console INPUT queue. Proving that with no
// human means manufacturing keystrokes with WriteConsoleInput and reading them back --
// and that round trip is irreducibly racy here: the console input buffer is SHARED with
// the parent shell across processes, and under ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT the console
// re-encodes input, so an assertion on the queue passes some runs and fails others. A
// hardware test that lies green half the time is exactly the trap a flaky hardware
// test sets, so it is NOT committed. The loop was verified by hand (feed a key-up + a
// resize, confirm readInput returns 0 without blocking, then a real key comes through)
// and, in practice, a broken peek loop hangs the monitor the first time you type -- it
// does not hide. The DETERMINISTIC half, the mode reconfiguration, is what runs here.
//
// SKIPS (exit 77, ctest's SKIP_RETURN_CODE) when there is no console to take -- a
// service, a detached job, some CI runners -- because a console test that passed with no
// console would be the green tick that lies. It also skips, rather than half-runs, when a
// console can be taken for only one of the two streams: under ctest on Windows stdin is
// the console but stdout is captured through a pipe, so a real console must be acquired
// for BOTH std handles before the assertions run.
