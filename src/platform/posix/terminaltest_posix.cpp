// THE TERMINAL LAYER, ON A REAL TTY.
//
// The PIPE path of terminal.h is proven in CI every build: acceptance-basic4k/8k feed a
// live guest keystrokes on a redirected stdin, so readInput()'s never-waiting contract
// and its closed-pipe EOF (which stops the run with InputEnded) all run there. What a
// piped test cannot reach is the TTY path -- a real terminal, which a pipe by definition
// is not -- and until this file existed nothing reached it: the POSIX terminal was
// "proven by hand against a pty", which is to say proven on the days somebody remembered
// to. Issue #25 is what that costs.
//
// WHAT WENT WRONG, and what this therefore asserts. Guest mode sets VMIN=0/VTIME=0, so
// a poll of the keyboard returns at once instead of waiting for a key. On macOS/BSD an
// empty read on THAT tty returns 0 -- the same number a hung-up pipe returns, and
// readInput() reported both as the end of input. So the first console poll of any RUN on
// a terminal latched Console::eof_, and starved() -- empty AND ENDED -- began counting on
// a keyboard that had not ended and never will. It failed for a user in a terminal and
// passed for us and for CI, every time, because we both run the suite on a pipe.
//
// r == 0 IS TWO DIFFERENT ANSWERS, and which one it is depends on what stdin is. Both
// halves are asserted below, side by side, because it is the DIFFERENCE between them
// that is the contract.
//
// WHY IT LIVES IN src/platform/posix/ AND NOT tests/. It opens a pty and drives termios
// directly; those are OS calls, and DESIGN.md 2.1 keeps OS calls in the platform layer.
// A test of OS-specific code is OS-specific code, so it sits beside the file it tests --
// the same reasoning, and the same shape, as terminaltest_win32.cpp.
//
// SKIPS (exit 77, ctest's SKIP_RETURN_CODE) when no pty can be opened -- a container with
// no /dev/pts, a sandbox, some CI runners -- because a tty test that passed with no tty
// would be the green tick that lies.
