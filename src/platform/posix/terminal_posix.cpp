// RESTORE ON SIGNAL.
//
// A C++ destructor does not run when a signal kills the process, and the ways out of
// this program that are not `EXIT` are signals:
//
//   - the operator's Ctrl-C at the monitor prompt (LineEdit mode leaves signals ON,
//     deliberately), and whatever the window manager or the shell sends when a terminal
//     window is closed (SIGINT, SIGHUP, SIGTERM, SIGQUIT); and
//   - a CRASH or a PANIC while the guest is running -- which is when the terminal is in
//     Guest raw mode and has the most to lose. bus.cpp calls std::abort() (SIGABRT) on an
//     internal invariant violation mid-emulation, and any SIGSEGV/SIGBUS/SIGFPE lands the
//     same way: with ECHO off and no destructor to put it back.
//
// Without this, any of them leaves the tty with ECHO off -- you get your shell back and
// it is silent, and you have to type `stty sane` at a prompt you cannot see. That is
// not a small annoyance; it is the difference between a tool people keep and one they
// uninstall. (SIGKILL alone cannot be caught, so it is the one case beyond our reach.)
//
// tcsetattr(), fcntl() and raise() are all on the POSIX async-signal-safe list, so this
// handler is doing nothing it is not allowed to do. It restores, puts the signal back
// to its default behaviour, and re-raises -- so the process still dies exactly as it
// would have (core dump and all, for a crash), with the right exit status, and nobody
// upstream can tell we were here.

// terminal cannot reach into a job that was deliberately detached from it.
//
// Installing a handler unconditionally would quietly override that, and
// `nohup swtpcsim -s longboot.cmd &` would start dying on a keystroke meant for
