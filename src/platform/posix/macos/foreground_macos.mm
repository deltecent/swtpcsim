//
// SDL was told not to bring us to the front on launch (SDL_MAC_BACKGROUND_APP), and
// that hint ALSO makes SDL skip the line that would otherwise have run:
//
//     [NSApp setActivationPolicy:NSApplicationActivationPolicyRegular];
//
// (src/video/cocoa/SDL_cocoaevents.m, Cocoa_RegisterApp). Without it a bare executable
// is left in a policy that has no Dock tile and that the window server will not
// activate, so clicking the video window does nothing. Putting the policy back is the
// whole of this file: it restores click-to-focus without asking to be activated, which
// is the distinction SDL's one hint does not let us draw.
//
// Regular is set rather than restored-to-what-it-was on purpose: it is what SDL itself
// would have set, so this leaves the process exactly where the default path leaves it,
// minus the activation.

// Modern macOS does not let an application drop the foreground into the void and
// expect the window server to find the next tenant -- activation is handed FROM one
// application TO another, and an app that merely resigns is liable to be handed
// straight back. Which is why the way in above bothers to remember who we took it from.
//
// So: yield to a named application. -yieldActivationToApplication: (macOS 14+) tells
// the window server that our successor's activation request is expected and should not
// be refused; -activate then makes it stick. Asked for by selector rather than guarded
// on a version, so an older system simply skips the first half -- where the plain
// activate was allowed anyway.
