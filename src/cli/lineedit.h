// The console line editor (DESIGN.md 10.4).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL, RATHER THAN std::getline:
//
// Because a terminal has exactly ONE erase character. The tty driver's VERASE is
// a single byte -- it is DEL (0x7F) on most Unixes, BS (0x08) on others, and what
// your terminal emulator actually SENDS when you hit the backspace key depends on
// the emulator, the OS, and $TERM. When they disagree, the erase byte is not
// erasing: it is just a control character, and the driver dutifully puts it in
// the line, where it prints as `^H` and you cannot get rid of it.
//
// You cannot fix that by picking the right VERASE, because there is no right one.
// The fix is to stop asking the driver to edit the line: take the terminal out of
// canonical mode, read bytes, and treat BOTH 0x08 AND 0x7F as backspace. Then it
// does not matter which one arrives, and it does not matter which OS you are on.
//
// A pipe or a script is NOT a terminal, so we fall back to getline there. Scripts,
// the test suite and --mcp all take that path and see no escape sequences at all.
