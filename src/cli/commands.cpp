// THE RANKING. Read it top to bottom: that IS the priority.
//
// The eight that own their prefix are Patrick's, 2026-07-11 (RUN took the slot GO
// held, and then RESET's -- 2026-07-13):
//   DUMP, STEP, RUN, HISTORY, MOUNT, BREAK, EDIT, CONFIG
//
// `D` is DUMP, which is what a ROM monitor's `D` has always been. SIMH made `D`
// DEPOSIT and `E` EXAMINE; this breaks with it deliberately. It also puts the
// shortest key on the keyboard on the command that cannot destroy anything, and
// makes you type two letters to change memory. DEPOSIT keeps the front panel's
// word -- it just costs `DE`.
//
// THE R-CLUSTER, and it is the same principle as `D` (Patrick, 2026-07-13): the
// shortest key goes to the command that cannot destroy anything, and the one that
// throws away the machine's state costs letters. A bare `R` must not reset. So RUN
// takes `R`, and the rest fall out of the order below with nobody deciding them:
//   R[UN]  RE[GS]  RES[ET]  REST[ORE]  REGI[ON]
//
// `built = false` means a command RESOLVES but does not run yet, and says so. That
// is on purpose: `S` must mean STEP from the first day, so that it does not mean
// SHOW until the CPU lands and then quietly change under someone's fingers. No
// command wears it today (RECORD/REPLAY/STOP were dropped, not deferred), but the
// mechanism stays for the next one that needs to claim a prefix before it works.
