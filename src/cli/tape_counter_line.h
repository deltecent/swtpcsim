// The live tape counter's terminal line -- the little state machine behind the
// `tape: 01:44 / 01:47 (98%)` readout the run loop paints while a cassette loads.
//
// It is deliberately pure and tty-free: given only what the deck and the console
// did this window, it decides what to do with our one \r-status line. The run loop
// owns the terminal; this owns the decision, so the decision can be tested without
// a pty (test_cli.cpp).
//
// WHY IT NEEDS A MEMORY AT ALL -- the resurrection bug (issue #165). The counter is
// a host courtesy readout; it counts how far the tape HEAD has moved, and knows
// nothing of loaders. A real loader stops reading the instant it has the program's
// bytes -- SHORT of the tape's trailing tone -- so the head parks before the end and
// the deck keeps offering a label (it still looks mid-load). The moment the loaded
// program prints its first prompt we yield the line, as we always did. But the guest
// then sits at that prompt going quiet between keystrokes, and a naive "quiet console
// + a live label -> paint" would repaint the stale `(98%)` right over the `?`, again
// and again. So once the guest has SPOKEN during a load, that load's counter is done
// for good -- `retired` latches -- and it re-arms only when the deck stops offering a
// label: back at the top of the tape (p == 0 after a rewind or a fresh mount), a stop
// mark, or an unmount -- exactly the boundary at which a genuinely new load begins.
// (Reaching the END is NOT one of those: the deck keeps offering its final 100% frame
// there, so the finished readout stays on screen -- see Cassette1602Board::activityLabel.)

#include <string>

// One line, one deck-load at a time. `shown`/`label` are the terminal state (is our
// line up, and what does it say); `retired` is the latch above. `update()` is called
// once per counter window with the board's activityLabel (empty when nothing is
// loading) and whether the console has been quiet since the previous window, and
// returns the single action the caller performs on the terminal.
