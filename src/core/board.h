// an ERROR with a sentence explaining it, not undefined behaviour that half-works.
//
// The index scheme was not merely inconvenient -- it could not be made safe. With
// a flat integer namespace, `MOUNT dj:4` on a serial unit can only fail; it can
// never explain, because the board has nothing to distinguish 4-the-drive from
// 4-the-port.

    // interrupt, because there was never a queue to lose it from.
    //
    // COMBINATIONAL AND PURE, exactly like decodes(). It reports the settled state
    // of a pin, computed from the state of the chip and nothing else. It does not
    // advance a receiver, take a byte off a line, or do any work the guest has not
    // paid for.
    //
    // IT USED TO DO ALL THREE, and there was a whole section of DESIGN.md (4.4.1)
    // defending that. A 6850 has to notice a character has finished arriving --
    // which happens on the chip's own clock, with no help from the CPU -- and the
    // only thing that ever woke the card up was being asked this question, so the
    // card advanced its receiver here. It worked. It was the wrong shape, and
    // Patrick named it (2026-07-12): a real bus does not poll a board for interrupt
    // status. The board sets a signal on the bus, the CPU reads it off the bus, and
    // the board clears it when its own design says to. Polling is not how any of
    // that works, so it is not how any of this should work.
    //
    // So the card does its free-running work on its OWN schedule now -- a Clock
    // deadline it sets itself, and pump(), which is where the host's keystrokes get
    // in -- and this is only ever asked what the pin SAYS. Which is what a wire is.
    //
    // The board does NOT supply a vector here. On the 6800 the interrupt is fixed:

    //     config, so these are already correct -- writing them would be a second
    //     copy that could disagree. (Machine::restore refuses a topology mismatch.)
    //
    //   - HOST RESOURCES -- a ByteStream/socket, a DiskImage, a Display, a HostDir.
    //     A handle cannot be serialized; it is re-opened from its (unchanged)
    //     config. In-flight bytes ON such a resource are the card's to keep: an
    //     uncommitted disk-write buffer or a half-typed hostbridge transfer IS
    //     runtime state and DOES travel, because it is not on the host yet.
    //
    //   - A Clock::Handle. NEVER serialize one. The Clock's event queue is closures
    //     that cannot travel (core/clock.h), so a board RE-ARMS its own deadlines in
    //     deserialize() -- via the path it already has (refresh(), armRtc(), ...) --
    //     from the state it just read. It does not try to restore the queue.
    //
    // The base handles enabled_ (a boot ROM that switched itself out must travel).
    // An override CHAINS to the base and adds its own fields. After every board has
