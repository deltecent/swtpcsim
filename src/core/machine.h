    // on the CPU card, so `clock_hz` is that BOARD's property (DESIGN.md 3, 8).
    // A machine-level copy would be a second place to say one thing, and the day
    // the two disagreed the machine would run at whichever was written last.

    // AND THERE IS NO MACHINE-LEVEL `sense` EITHER, for exactly the reason above.
    // It was here once: a byte, parsed from `[machine] sense`, printed by SHOW
    // MACHINE -- and connected to nothing, because no board decoded port 0xFF. The
    // guest's `IN 0FFH` read the floating bus and got 0xFF whatever the operator
    // configured, which meant the DBL boot PROM (it tests bit 4 to pick the 2SIO's
    // stop bits) was reading a wire, not a switch.
    //
    // The switches are on the front panel, the front panel is a card, and the card
    // is `fp` (boards/mits-frontpanel.h). That is where the byte lives now.

    // Monitor commands run once the backplane exists. This is why there is no
    // BOOT command (DESIGN.md 10.0): a config that should boot says
    // startup = ["GO FF00"], which is the operator's keystroke, written down.

    // lives in .rodata and is in no directory at all, so every path it names can only

    // But empty does NOT mean "built-in": a file NAMED IN THE CWD (`swtpcsim foo.toml`
    // from foo.toml's own folder) has an empty dirname too, and its paths correctly
    // resolve against the shell just the same. So `dir.empty()` cannot tell a built-in
    // from a cwd-local file -- an empty dirname and no file are different answers that
