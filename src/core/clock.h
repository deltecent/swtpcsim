// Clock -- the single source of emulated time, and the queue of things that are
// going to happen in it (DESIGN.md 7.5).
//
// Time is measured in CYCLES, never in milliseconds, and it advances only
// when the CPU retires an instruction. Nothing in the simulator may ask the host
// what time it is; if a board could, replay would be dead the first time one did.
//
// The crystal is on the CPU CARD (DESIGN.md 3, 8) -- there is no machine clock
// rate. The card publishes its `clock_hz` here, which is how a board that needs
// to convert real units (a baud rate, a disk RPM) into cycles finds the
// conversion factor without knowing which card holds the crystal, or whether
// there is one at all.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE EVENT QUEUE IS BACK, AND THE BOARD CITED AS PROVING IT UNNECESSARY IS THE
// BOARD THAT PROVED IT NECESSARY (Patrick, 2026-07-12).
//
// A previous version of this file deleted `schedule()` from the design and
// argued the point at length, right here. The argument was: a board is already
// POLLED for everything the bus can observe about it -- `decodes()` on every
// cycle, `assertsInt()` on every instruction boundary -- so a board never needs
// to be WOKEN. It only needs to answer "what time is it?" when someone asks.
//
// THAT ARGUMENT WAS CIRCULAR, and the circle was hiding the bug. The board did
// not need waking BECAUSE WE WERE POLLING IT SIXTY MILLION TIMES A SECOND. The
// poll was not evidence that the queue was unnecessary; the poll WAS the queue,
// run at enormous cost and called something else.
//
// And the poll had to go, because it was never how the machine worked: a bus
// does not interrogate a card for its interrupt status. A card PULLS the IRQ line and
// HOLDS it, and the CPU reads the wire (Patrick, 2026-07-12). Take the poll away
// and the board is left holding a deadline it has no way to be present for:
//
//   A 6850 with the transmit interrupt jumpered raises IRQ when its shift
//   register drains. Nobody touches it. No bus cycle happens. And the guest is
//   sitting in a HLT waiting for precisely that interrupt. If the only way the
//   card can act is to BE ASKED, and the only thing that would ask is the CPU
//   that is halted waiting for it, then nothing ever happens again.
//
// So a deadline needs a way to arrive on its own. That is this queue.
//
// What was RIGHT in the old argument, and still is: TDRE is a DEADLINE, not an
// event. A board that can answer "what time is it?" when the guest finally reads
// the status port should do exactly that and schedule nothing -- and the 6850
// still does, for the polled case. You come here only for the state changes that
// must be VISIBLE TO SOMEONE ELSE the instant they happen, and on this bus there
// is exactly one such thing: a wire.
