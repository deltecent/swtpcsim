// A tiny expression, for BREAK <addr> IF <expr> (DESIGN.md 10, the DEBUG block).
//
// IT IS CPU-AGNOSTIC, ON PURPOSE. It resolves a register's VALUE by name through a
// callback and never learns what an 8080 is -- the same bet registers()-as-
// reflection already makes (DESIGN.md 3.0.3), so a Z80 gets conditional
// breakpoints on the day it lands with nothing written here.
//
// Grammar (|| binds loosest, a primary tightest):
//
//     or   := and  ('||' and)*
//     and  := cmp  ('&&' cmp)*
//     cmp  := bor  (('=='|'!='|'<='|'>='|'<'|'>') bor)?
//     bor  := band ('|' band)*
//     band := prim ('&' prim)*
//     prim := NUMBER | REGISTER | '(' or ')'
//
// A NUMBER is HEX -- it is a value the guest could hold, and those are hex on the
// wire (DESIGN.md 10.0.1). A bare word that NAMES a register IS that register, so
// `A` is the accumulator and the literal ten is written `0A` -- exactly as
// `(A&0F)==0` writes fifteen. The leading zero is how you say "I meant the number".
