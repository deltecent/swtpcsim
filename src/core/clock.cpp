// WHEN THE THING ACTUALLY HAPPENED, not where the instruction that carried us past
// it happened to end. An instruction is up to 12 cycles long and a board's
// deadline lands wherever it lands inside that; a board that asks the time and is
// told the wrong one -- or that schedules `now() + charTime` and quietly drifts by
// up to 12 cycles per character -- is a bug that would take a very long time to
// see. The clock is the one thing in this simulator that must never lie about the
// time.
//
// A callback MAY schedule more work -- a UART re-arming for the next character does
// exactly that -- and if it schedules something already due, that fires in this same
// drain. Which is correct, and is also precisely how you would write an infinite
// loop: a board that re-arms at now() every time never lets go. So boards schedule
// STRICTLY IN THE FUTURE, and it is the board's job to guarantee it (see
