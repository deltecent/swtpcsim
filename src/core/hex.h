// Anchored to `first` (file order), NOT to lo() (lowest address). On the ordinary
// ascending hex file those are the same byte, which is exactly why anchoring to the
// wrong one would be invisible until the file that descends.

// THE DELTA WRAPS, MODULO 64K, and that is the format's own arithmetic rather than a
// convenience: hexfrmt defines the address as "[DRLO + DRI] MOD 64K" and says wraparound
// "from 0FFFFH to 00000H results in wrapping around from the end to the beginning". It is
// also what the hardware does -- an 8080 has sixteen address lines and no seventeenth to
// carry into. A file whose first record is F000, loaded AT 0, puts its F800 record at
// 0800 and an E000 record back up at F000.

// 16-bit only -- the 680b is a 16-bit machine, so an address above 0xFFFF is a
// caller bug rather than a reason to reach for S2/S3 here.
