// The debugger (DESIGN.md 3.0.3).
//
// IT IS NOT A CPU FEATURE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE DESIGN. If a core owned
// breakpoints, every core would reimplement them and they would differ in small
// maddening ways. They do not belong there:
//
//   BREAK MEM / TRACE / HISTORY  are questions about BUS CYCLES, and
//     the bus already shows every cycle to everyone watching (Bus::observe).
//     They are CPU-agnostic and the machinery already existed.
//
//   BREAK <addr>  is the one CPU-flavoured one, and it is just "PC equals X after
//     a step" -- one comparison against a register the reflection layer already
//     exposes. It does not know what a 6800 is.
//
// So a future 6809 card inherits the ENTIRE debugger on the day it lands
// without a line being written here.
