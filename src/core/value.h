// Value + Property -- the reflection layer (DESIGN.md 5).
//
// This is the keystone of the whole program. The monitor's SET/SHOW, the TOML
// loader, CONFIG SAVE, the MCP tool schemas, and tab completion are ALL written
// once against Board::properties() and know nothing board-specific. A board
// added next year is configurable, scriptable, agent-drivable and completable
// the day it lands, with no change to any of those five consumers.
//
// The cost of that is this file: a property has to carry enough metadata to
// validate, render, and describe itself. That is the whole trick.

//   ON THE WIRE -> HEX.  NEVER ON THE WIRE -> DECIMAL.  (Patrick, 2026-07-11)
//
// The base is a property of the OPERAND, so the CALLER supplies the default and
// the caller is the only one who knows: an address, a port or a data byte is hex
// (the 8080 sees it); a count, a size, a baud rate or a unit number is decimal
// (it never leaves the operator's head). Properties carry theirs as `radix`.
//
// Notations, all understood regardless of the default, in both directions:
//   0xFF  $FF  FFh  0FFH   force hex        #255   forces decimal
//   0o377  377q            force octal      0b1010 binary
//   1_000  digit separators
//   48K  2M                 a SIZE SUFFIX IS ALWAYS DECIMAL and always wins,
//                           so `0x10K` / `0o10K` is a contradiction and is REJECTED.

    // compares against. An alias is accepted AT THE DOOR and canonicalised there, so a
    // board cannot learn that its key has two names and no two consumers can disagree
    // about which one is real. That is the whole reason this is one field on the schema
    // rather than an extra string compare in each board.
    //
    // It exists because the operator's vocabulary and the file's drifted apart: a drive
    // is WRITE-PROTECTED everywhere a person is spoken to -- the CLI, SHOW MOUNTS, the
    // manual, the tab on a real diskette -- and `readonly = true` in the file. Neither
    // spelling is wrong, so the fix is to accept both rather than to break the one that
    // is in every machine file that already exists.
    //
    // Use it SPARINGLY. Two spellings for one key is a small tax on everybody reading
    // somebody else's file; it is worth paying to reconcile vocabulary we already ship,
    // and not worth paying to save a reader a trip to the reference.
    //
    // ACCEPTING is generic (Board::loadSubUnit, setOne); DISPLAYING is per-consumer, and
    // today the only aliased key is a sub-unit one, so the generated reference, the MCP
    // schema and SHOW's `[[board.<table>]]` listing print aliases and Monitor::showProps
    // does not. Put an alias on a SETTABLE property and that is the fourth place to teach.
