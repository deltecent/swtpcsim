// Built-in ROMs (DESIGN.md 10.3.1).
//
// The image file from roms/<NAME>/ is embedded VERBATIM -- the generated table
// holds the bytes of DBL.HEX, not a decoded image. The decode happens here, at
// runtime, with the same Intel HEX parser that backs LOAD. A built-in and a
// mounted file therefore travel identical code, and cannot drift.
//
// Provenance for every ROM is in docs/roms.md, and a test checks each CRC32.
// A ROM image is a hardware fact (DESIGN.md 0.1): an embedded blob of unknown
// lineage is the worst kind of second-hand fact, because everything above it
// gets debugged against the wrong ground truth and it looks like a software bug
// for a very long time.
