// Spindle -- the rotating disk, as a pure function of time (DESIGN.md 7.5.1).
//
// A floppy turns whether or not anyone is looking at it. So the sector under the
// head is not STATE that a controller advances; it is a READING taken off the
// clock, and this class is the whole of that arithmetic:
//
//     sector = (now / tPerSector) % sectors
//
// THERE IS NO HIDDEN COUNTER AND NO ADVANCE-ON-READ. That matters more than it
// looks. A counter that ticks when the guest reads the sector-position port makes
// the disk's rotation depend on how often the guest polls -- so a tight polling
// loop spins the disk faster than a slow one, the drive runs at the speed of the
// software watching it, and a recorded session stops replaying identically. Derive
// it from the clock and every one of those goes away for free.
//
// TWO CARDS NEED THIS, FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, AND THAT IS WHY IT IS HERE AND NOT ON
// EITHER OF THEM:
//
//   - the 88-DCDD hands the sector number straight to the guest at `IN 0x09`;
//   - the Tarbell never exposes it, but its FD1771's Read Address command (0xC4) has
//     to answer "which sector is under the head right now" so the buffered CP/M BIOS
//     can start a track read where the head already is. A static answer spins that
//     BIOS forever.
//
// Same arithmetic, so: written once. The Spindle knows about Clock and NOTHING else
// -- not a board, not a MediaFile, not a sector's contents. It hands back an INDEX,
// 0-based; a controller that numbers its sectors from 1 (the Tarbell does; the DCDD
// does not) adds its own startSector. That off-by-one is the one that silently
// corrupts a disk, so it stays where the board can see it and is deliberately NOT
// buried in here.
