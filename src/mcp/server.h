// MCP server (DESIGN.md 11).
//
// MCP IS A FIRST-CLASS INTERFACE, NOT A WRAPPER. It does not shell out to the
// monitor and it does not screen-scrape: it sits on the same Machine and the
// same Board::properties() the CLI does, so the two cannot drift, and every
// result is structured JSON rather than an ASCII table someone has to re-parse.
//
// The clearest proof of that is board_set: its input schema is GENERATED from
// properties() at request time. A board added next year is fully agent-drivable
// -- with correct enums, ranges and runtime-settability -- the day it lands,
// and not one line of this file changes.

// `mirror` (empty = off) is a `socket:PORT[?ro]` spec: when set, the console the
// interactive tools drive is wrapped in a MirrorStream, so a human can `telnet` in to
// WATCH the session the assistant is running and TYPE back onto the line to take over
// (issue #381). The assistant still feed()/out()s the inner scripted line unchanged --
// the wrapper is transparent to the run loop.
