// The instruction set -- a STATELESS disassembler (DESIGN.md 3.0.2).
//
// Bytes in, text and a length out. No registers, no bus, no board, no CPU.
//
// This is a layer of its own because "CPU" is three things wearing one name:
//
//   instruction set   how bytes decode            <- THIS FILE
//   core              registers + execute         src/cpu/
//   card              the thing you pull out      src/boards/
//
// Two 8080 cards that differ only in an onboard serial port share the
// instruction set and the core COMPLETELY, and differ only in the card -- which
// is the only place they differ in reality (Patrick, 2026-07-11). The thing they
// have in common is not the chip and not the board: it is the way bytes decode,
// and that is why it needs a name of its own to be shared by.
//
// AND IT RUNS WITH NO CPU IN THE MACHINE. `DISASM FF00 CPU=8080` worked in
// milestone 1a, against the DBL PROM, before a single instruction could execute
// -- which is the same argument that made the bus testable before the CPU
// existed, and it means the decode tables get exercised long before anything
// runs them.
