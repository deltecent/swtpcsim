// FD1771 -- Western Digital's Floppy Disk Formatter/Controller. The first of the
// family; the one the Tarbell soft-sector card is built around.
//
// A CHIP, NOT A CARD. The Tarbell Floppy Disk Interface has one of these on it, and
// the next card to turn up with one gets it for free. Modeled from the FD1771 data
// sheet (reference/Western Digital FD1771 - Datasheet.pdf), cross-checked against
// the copy Tarbell reprinted as section 7-2 of their own manual -- NOT from the one
// BIOS that happens to drive it, which is how you end up implementing the subset
// that BIOS uses and quietly getting the rest wrong.
//
// It knows nothing about S-100, and it knows nothing about the Tarbell's ports.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THE FILE IS `wd17xx` AND THE CLASS IS `Wd1771`.
//
// The family shares a register file and a command set, and a later card will want
// the FD1791/93. It will NOT want this class: the 179x is a different chip in the
// ways that bite (MFM, side select, a one-bit record type). So the FILE is the
// family and the CLASS is the part, and the 1793 lands next to this one rather than
// inside it, behind a `#ifdef` that would be a lie either way.
//
// AND IT IS NOT THE WD1770/72/73. `reference/Western Digital WD177X-00 - Datasheet.pdf`
// is in the tree and it is THE WRONG CHIP for this card -- a 28-pin part with an
// on-board data separator, MFM, and motor control. Its step-rate table reads
// 6/12/20/30 ms. THE FD1771's READS 6/6/10/20 (Table 1, at CLK=2 MHz). A chip built
// from that sheet would look right, compile, boot nothing, and step at the wrong
// speed forever. Do not "fix" this file against it.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT IS ON THE OTHER END OF THE DISK PINS.
//
// The same seam ByteStream is for the 6850: the chip owns no image, no file and no
// geometry. It has pins -- STEP, DIRC, TR00, WPRT, READY, IP -- and a drive on the
// far end of them, and this is that drive.
//
// NOTE WHAT IS *NOT* HERE, because it is the whole chip/board split in one absence:
//
//   - NO DRIVE SELECT. The FD1771 has no drive-select pin. It talks to ONE drive,
//     and the CARD's select latch decides which. So the board calls attach() and
//     the chip is none the wiser -- which is exactly what the silicon does.
//   - NO SIDE SELECT. Same reason: the 1771 has no such pin either.
//   - NO MOTOR CONTROL. That is a WD1770 thing, and this is not one.
//
// THE HEAD POSITION LIVES HERE, NOT IN THE TRACK REGISTER. This is the distinction
// the whole seek/verify mechanism is built on and it is worth being blunt about: the
// chip's Track Register is SOFTWARE'S BOOKKEEPING -- a number the guest wrote, or
// that the chip counted up as it pulsed STEP. Where the head physically IS is the
// drive's business and only the drive's. They are allowed to disagree, and when they
// do, a verify sets Seek Error (S4). Fold them into one variable and Seek Error can
// never happen, which means a driver's error recovery is never exercised, and the
// first real disk with a bad ID field silently reads the wrong track.

    //

    // Register). It is a LIST AND NOT A LOOKUP on purpose: Read Address returns "the
    // next ID field encountered", which is a question about rotation, and a map keyed
    // by sector number could not answer it.
    // ---- ONE DELIBERATE DEVIATION, AND IT IS HERE ----
    //
    // On the real chip, how many bytes a Read or Write moves is decided by the COMMAND's
    // `b` flag together with the ID field's length code -- the Type II flow chart has a box
    // for it: "COMPUTE LENGTH FROM b FLAG". b=1 gives IBM sizes (128 << n); b=0 gives
    // non-IBM ones (16 x N, where a code of 0 means 256 groups, i.e. 4096 bytes).
    //
    // The two readings COLLIDE: length code 00 is 128 bytes under b=1 and 4096 under b=0.
    // The chip decides, and the disk cannot.
    //
    // THIS CHIP DOES NOT DO THAT ARITHMETIC. It moves `size` bytes, and the DRIVE is what
    // decoded them. Why: the drive is the only thing here that knows its own format, and a
    // raw sector image physically cannot serve a length the format did not record. Ask a
    // real controller for 4096 bytes out of a 128-byte sector and it reads on through the
    // gaps and the next eleven sectors and hands back the lot with a CRC error. There are
    // no gaps in a .DSK to read through -- so honouring `b` would mean INVENTING the
    // garbage, which is precisely what DESIGN.md 0.1 forbids.
    //
    // To be observable you need a driver whose `b` flag disagrees with the disk in its own
    // drive -- a driver that is already broken on real hardware. Written down rather than
    // left to be discovered. If a disk ever turns up that needs it, start here.

    //
    // NOT PURE, AND FALSE BY DEFAULT, because a drive backed by a raw .DSK genuinely

// THE FD177x FAMILY -- the base, and the parts.
//
// `Wd17xx` is the whole register file and state machine, which every part in the
// family shares byte-for-byte (that is what "the family shares a register file and a
// command set" means, and it is why it lives in ONE class and not three copies). The
// PARTS -- Wd1771, Wd1791 -- are the leaves, and each supplies only the handful of
// behaviors that genuinely differ between the silicon:
//
//   - the STEP-RATE table (Table 1 is not the same on the 1771 and the 1791);
//   - the READ ADDRESS side byte (the 1771 has no side pin and hard-zeros it; the
//     179x carries the head/side number the board selected);
//   - the RECORD TYPE (the 1771 has FOUR data address marks and reports two status
//     bits; the 179x has TWO and reports one);
//   - which DATA ADDRESS MARK a Write command writes (the a1a0 field on the 1771; a
//     single a0 bit on the 179x).
//
// So the base is abstract: it cannot answer those four questions itself, and it must
// not guess. A board constructs the PART it has on it (Wd1771 for a VersaFloppy I or a
// Tarbell SD card; Wd1791 for a VersaFloppy II or a Tarbell DD card), and the base
// runs the command set through the part's answers. New part, new leaf -- next to these,
// never inside one, exactly as the file-level note above lays out.

    // ---- MASTER RESET -- pin 19, AND THIS CHIP REALLY HAS ONE ----
    //
    // Unlike the 6850 (which has no reset pin at all -- see mc6850.h), the FD1771 has
    // MR, and on the Tarbell the S-100 RESET* reaches it. What it does is NOT "clear
    // the registers", and if you assume it is you will be hunting the difference for
    // a day:
    //
    //   "A logic low on this input resets the device and loads '03' into the command
    //    register. The Not Ready (Status bit 7) is reset during MR ACTIVE. When MR is
    //    brought to a logic high, A RESTORE COMMAND IS EXECUTED, regardless of the
    //    state of the Ready signal from the drive."
    //
    // So a front-panel RESET does not merely idle the controller -- IT DRIVES THE HEAD
    // BACK TO TRACK 0, by itself, with no help from any software. 0x03 is Restore with

    // runs the state machine forward, stopping only where it genuinely needs the guest --
    // the next byte of a transfer, which the data register serves on demand. A status read
    // therefore returns the finished result and a data read the next byte, each exactly as
    // if the CPU had waited on PRDY. It is FAITHFUL, not a shortcut: a wait-stalled CPU
    // cannot observe seek time, byte timing, or reach Lost Data -- so the collapsed command
    // time is invisible, and Lost Data (which the wait-state hardware exists to prevent) is
    // correctly unreachable. Off by default: a DRQ-polling card leaves it alone and gets the
