// The lesson recurs: what a signal MEANS is a property of the HONORING board, not
// of the wire. The 2SIO manual's hardwire table gives CTS and DCD their own
// jumper pads -- whether the 6850's pin reaches the connector or is strapped to
// ground is a property of the CARD, not of whatever is plugged into it, and period
// installers grounded them constantly.
//
// Default GROUND, which is both the period default and the reason every existing
// config keeps working untouched: a grounded pin never asks the far end anything,
// so a card on the console transmits forever and receives forever, exactly as it
// does today.
//
// And it dissolves the "what if there is no real serial port" question entirely.
// There is no unconnected case to handle: an unplugged unit is a NullStream, which
// asserts everything, and a card strapped to `ground` never even looks.

    // reading.)

    //   - `clock_hz = 0` is INVISIBLE TO THE GUEST. It changes only the mapping from

    //     it. That is exactly why flat out is a safe default (clock.h).
    //
    //   - `baud` is a DURATION IN CYCLES -- INSIDE emulated time -- so the guest can and

    //     infer the line speed; see txFreeAt_). The INTER-CHARACTER GAP ON RECEIVE is the
    //     other, and it is the one that bites: the 6850 has no handshaking, so THE BAUD RATE
    //     IS THE ONLY FLOW CONTROL THIS CARD HAS. In this simulator it is specifically what
    //     turns a host PASTE -- ten bytes appearing in the pty at once -- into a paced serial
    //     stream. At baud = 0 a character occupies the line for ZERO cycles, so the next

    // foreground (090C) through a ONE-BYTE mailbox at 0966 and a semaphore at 0967, and that
    // handoff requires the foreground to run BETWEEN characters. At baud = 0 it gets zero
