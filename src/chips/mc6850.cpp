// WHY THIS DOES NOT SYNTHESIZE OVRN, having tried to.
//
// The first version pulled a byte every character-time whether or not the guest
// had read the last one, and raised OVRN and DISCARDED the byte when it hadn't.
// That is what a real 6850 does, and it is wrong here -- it lost data
// immediately and visibly. ALTMON echoes the full command name as you type
// ("D" -> "DUMP "), and while it was busy transmitting those five characters it
// was not reading the receiver, so the address you typed after the D was thrown
// on the floor. The dump command silently did nothing.
//
// The bug was not the pacing. It was believing a ByteStream is a serial LINE.
//
// A real line is free-running: the sender shoves bits down the wire on its own
// clock and the receiver keeps up or loses them, which is what an overrun IS. A
// ByteStream is nothing like that. It is a buffered, flow-controlled source -- a
// pipe, a socket, an OS keyboard queue -- and it is perfectly happy to hold the
// byte until we take it. Inventing an overrun from it does not reproduce a
// hardware behaviour; it MANUFACTURES data loss that the host transport does not
// have, and it breaks transfers that would have worked.
//
// So: pace the arrivals at the baud rate (that part is real, it is what stops
// the guest reading faster than the line allows, and it is the same clock TDRE
// is timed against) -- but only ever take a byte when the register is free.
//
// The honest consequence is that status bit 5 is always zero, and that is
// a documented limitation rather than one left for
// someone to discover. If a HOST SERIAL PORT endpoint ever lands, an overrun
// there is a genuine hardware event and the stream can report it -- from the
// place that actually knows, which is not here.

//
//   - THE MASTER RESET is the GUEST's: 11 in the divide field. It does NOT clear the
//     control register -- "Master reset does not affect other Control Register bits" --
//     it latches the whole byte it arrived in, and it HOLDS the chip down until a
//     second control write. That is writeControl(), modeled to the letter, because
//     guest software can see, time and depend on every part of it.
//
//   - THE BUS RESET (RESET*, the front-panel switch) DOES NOT REACH THIS CHIP AT ALL.
//     The 6850 has no reset pin. Nothing here happens on one, and the card must not
//     invent it -- see Sio2Board::reset().
//
//   - THIS is the machine being switched on. It zeroes the control register, which no
//     external pin on the real chip can do, because the real chip HAS NO SUCH PIN: at
//     power-up an internal reset holds the ACIA until the guest's first master reset
//     releases it. We do not model the holding (nothing can observe it that does not
//     also program the chip) -- we simply come up in a known good state, at once, so
//     that a machine is usable the moment it is switched on. DESIGN.md 6.1.
