// stop bits opens the host port at 7E2, because that is what a COM2502 strapped
// that way actually puts on the line. Every other endpoint ignores this -- a
// socket has no baud rate and a tape has no parity -- which is exactly why it is
// pushed at the stream and not implemented in the chip.
//
// NOTE WHAT THIS IS NOT: it is not a mask. The chip never ANDs the guest's data
// with the word length. If a card is strapped for 7 bits then the eighth bit does
// not travel, because the frame does not carry it -- and if it is strapped for 8,
// all eight arrive, MITS BASIC's terminator included. That is the hardware, and

// A real line is free-running: the sender shoves bits down the wire on its own clock,

// source -- a pipe, a socket, an OS keyboard queue -- and it is perfectly happy to
// hold the byte until we take it. Inventing an overrun from it does not reproduce a
// hardware behaviour; it MANUFACTURES data loss that the host transport does not have.
//
// So: pace the arrivals at the line rate (that part is real, and it is the same clock
// TBMT is timed against) -- but only ever take a byte when the register is free.
