// COM2502 -- the 1602-family UART. SMC's part; the same 40-pin chip everyone else
// second-sourced as the AY-5-1013 (GI), the TR1602 (Western Digital) and the
// IM6402 (Intersil). Modeled from reference/com2502.pdf.
//
// A CHIP, NOT A CARD. The serial base has one of these on it (src/boards/serial1602.h),
// and so does the cassette board built on it (some manuals identify the part as an
// AY-5-1013/TR1602, the same chip under a different silk screen). One chip, many boards,
// and this is where it lives so that none of them grows its own hand-rolled half of it.
//
// It knows nothing about any board's status-word wiring. THE CHIP'S STATUS IS TRUE
// SENSE -- RDA high means a character is waiting, TBMT high means the transmit buffer is
// free -- because that is what the pins do. A board that runs some of them through
// inverting buffers on the way to the bus does so itself; the inversion is THE BOARD'S,
// and it stays on the board (e.g. KcacrBoard::statusByte()).
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHAT IS A REGISTER HERE AND WHAT IS A PIN, because on this chip it is not what
// forty years of memory-mapped UARTs would lead you to expect.
//
// There is NO control register. None. The word format -- 5-8 data bits, 1 or 2 stop
// bits, no/odd/even parity -- arrives on FIVE DEDICATED PINS (NDB1, NDB2, NSB, NPB,
// POE), and on both cards that use this chip those pins go to solder pads. Software
// cannot change the frame on the wire; a soldering iron can. That is the deepest
// difference between this chip and the 6850, where the identical numbers come out
// of a control register the guest wrote, and it is why they are two files.
//
// The status word is real, though, and it IS a register: /SWE (pin 16, Status Word
// Enable) gates RPE, RFE, ROR, RDA and TBMT onto the bus together, out of the
// chip's own status word buffer. The board decides where those five bits land and
// which way up -- but the chip is what HAS them.
