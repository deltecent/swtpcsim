// CpuCore -- registers and execute. THE CHIP, NOT THE CARD (DESIGN.md 3).
//
// A core is a plain object. It is NOT a Board: it has no slot, decodes no
// address, owns no clock crystal, and cannot be pulled out of the backplane with
// your hand. All of that belongs to the card that carries it (src/boards/), and
// the separation is what lets two different 8080 cards -- one with an onboard
// serial port, one without -- share this file completely.
//
// It is also what makes the validation gate (DESIGN.md 3.2) easy: TST8080 and
// 8080EXM test the CHIP, and here the chip is a thing you can hold on its own.

// REGISTERS ARE REFLECTION -- the same trick as Board::properties() (DESIGN.md
// 3.0.3, 5).
//
// A core describes its own registers; it does NOT expose a struct the monitor
// knows the shape of. So REGS, SET REG A=3F, breakpoint conditions, SNAPSHOT and
// the MCP schema are written ONCE, generically, and a Z80 or a 6502 gets every
// one of them on the day it lands with no change to the monitor.
//
// This is the same bet that already paid for SET/SHOW/TOML/MCP. There is one
// schema and no second copy to drift.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// HOW a register wants to APPEAR. The monitor prints a one-line, DDT/SID-style
// status at every stop:
//
//     C0Z1M0E1I0 A=3F BC=0000 DE=00FF HL=8000 SP=0100 IE=1 PC=0102  MOV A,B
//
// The LAYOUT of that line -- which registers pair up, which ones are lamps, what
// each is called, and in what order -- is the CORE's to describe, because it is
// genuinely different for a Z80 or a 6502. But it is the MONITOR's to render, and
// the monitor still knows nothing: it reads `show`, `label` and `bits`, and that
// is all. Reflection holds (3.0.3); we did not hand the core a printf.

    Off,    // reachable BY NAME (SET REG, breakpoints, MCP) but not on the line
};

    // NAME is identity -- what you TYPE, and what SET REG and a breakpoint
    // condition look up. LABEL is presentation -- what the status line CALLS it.
