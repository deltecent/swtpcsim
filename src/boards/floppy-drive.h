// DiskImageDrive -- a FloppyDrive (chips/wd17xx.h) backed by a DiskImage (host/disk.h).
//
// THE MISSING HALF OF THE WD-CHIP SEAM. The FD177x is a chip with pins -- STEP, TR00,
// READY, and a data path that moves whole sectors -- and `FloppyDrive` is the abstract
// drive on the far end of them. Wd17xx ships with the interface but no implementation,
// because the only card that ever wired the chip up (the Tarbell) was dropped before it
// landed. This is that implementation, and it is deliberately GENERIC: it knows the chip's
// pins and a DiskImage, and nothing about which card is holding either. The VersaFloppy is
// the first to use it; a Tarbell SD/DD card would use the very same adapter.
//
// WHERE THE CHIP/DRIVE SPLIT LANDS (see wd17xx.h at length):
//
//   - NO DRIVE SELECT. The chip talks to ONE drive; the CARD's select latch decides which,
//     by pointing the chip at one of these with Wd17xx::attach(). So there is one adapter
//     per physical drive, and the board attaches the selected one.
//   - THE HEAD POSITION LIVES HERE, not in the chip's Track Register. `head_` is where the
//     head physically is; the chip's track register is software's bookkeeping, and the two
//     are allowed to disagree (that is what a verify catches). step() moves the head; the
//     chip never writes it.
//   - SIDE IS THE CARD'S. The 179x has a side pin but the VersaFloppy drives it from its own
//     control latch, so the board sets side_ (it is the DiskImage head index too).
//
// A raw .DSK holds SECTOR PAYLOADS ONLY -- no gaps, no address marks, no CRCs (host/disk.h).
// So the ID fields are SYNTHESIZED from the mounted image's declared geometry (sectorIdAt),
// the CRCs always check (images do not carry the rot that makes a bad CRC), and the whole-
// track calls stay false -- a format has nowhere to put gaps that were never in the file,
// and the chip already says so out loud (WRITE FAULT) rather than inventing them.
