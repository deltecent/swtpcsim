// The `memory` board -- docs/boards/s100-memory.md.
//
// ONE BOARD IS ONE CARD. A card carrying 48K of RAM and three PROM sockets is
// one board, so this class holds a LIST OF REGIONS, each `ram` or `rom`. That
// collapse is what makes an empty PROM socket and an unpopulated RAM page the
// same case: neither is covered by a region, so the board does not decode it,
// nothing drives the bus, and it reads 0xFF.
//
// THERE IS NO WRITE-PROTECT ON THIS BOARD, and there must never be one. A `rom`
// region simply DOES NOT DECODE A WRITE CYCLE -- it does not reject the write,
// or ignore it, or log it. It never answers. Everything else (the byte
// vanishing, or falling through to RAM on another card) is emergent from what
// else is on the bus, and needs no rule anywhere.

// BANK SWITCHING LIVES ON ITS OWN BOARD NOW -- `bankmem` (src/boards/bankmem.h).
// This board used to carry a `bank_type=` strap with one SIMH-derived encoding for
// all five real cards; docs/devguide/banked-ram.md audited that against the period
// manuals and found it wrong for four of them, because they are genuinely different
// decoders (DESIGN.md 4.3). So `memory` is purely plain RAM/ROM again -- which is
// also the honest model of the SD Systems ExpandoRAM I, a static-strapped board with
// no I/O port at all.

    // ...AND WHERE THAT PATH ACTUALLY LEADS. The two differ only when the ROM was
    // named by a machine file in another directory (core/paths.h): `mount` is what
    // the file said, `mountFile` is where we found it.
    //
    // THIS CARD IS THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS TO KEEP BOTH, and the reason is power():
    // a ROM region is re-read from the host on EVERY power cycle, long after the
    // loader has packed up and gone home. A disk or a tape is opened once and the
    // handle survives, so those cards resolve and forget. This one cannot.

    // PUT THE IMAGE HERE, don't ASSERT it is already here. A HEX/S-record image
    // carries its own addresses, so by default `at` is checked against them and a
    // mismatch is an error (loadRomRegion) -- a ROM at the wrong address is a bug you
    // would chase for an hour. `relocate` flips that to LOAD's `AT` semantics: shift
    // the image so its first record lands at `at` (relocateTo, core/hex.h), exactly as
    // `LOAD prog.hex AT 100` does and as a `Bin` region's `at` already does.
    //
    // WHY A CARD NEEDS THIS: a monitor ROM that is address-decoded MIRRORED. The SWTPC
    // 6800's 1K SWTBUG ROM stores the 6800 vectors at E3F8-E3FF, and the board decodes
    // the chip across the top of memory so the CPU's FFF8-FFFF vector fetch reads them.
    // That is TWO regions onto ONE builtin: one self-placed at E000, one `relocate`d so
    // the same bytes also answer at the top of memory. No swtpcsim machine needs it --
    // its ROMs each self-place over what they use -- which is why the default stays the
    // strict check.
