rem NO DEVELOPER SHELL IS REQUIRED, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT ON WINDOWS. CMake's default
rem Visual Studio generator invokes MSBuild, which locates the MSVC toolchain itself, so a
rem plain PowerShell or cmd works. The current documentation makes it look like a Developer
rem shell is mandatory; it is not, and this script is the proof. MSVC is the only supported
rem Windows toolchain (DISTRIBUTION.md, docs/building-windows.md).
rem
rem SDL3 STAYS OPTIONAL. A plain `build.bat` builds against a null display with nothing
rem installed. --with-sdl builds a private static SDL3 (tools\build-sdl3-static.bat) and
rem links it -- and on Windows also matches the C runtime (/MT), so the .exe needs no VC++
rem redistributable and asks nothing of the machine it runs on.
rem
rem VERIFIED on Windows 10 (MSVC 2022 Build Tools), 2026-07-22, from a clean build dir: a plain
rem run built swtpcsim.exe and printed its version with no Developer shell; --with-sdl linked a
rem static SDL3 and a static /MT CRT (dumpbin /dependents showed system DLLs only -- no SDL3.dll,
rem no VCRUNTIME140); --help rendered and a bad argument exited 2. The macOS twin is build.sh.

rem Run from anywhere: everything is relative to the repository this script lives in.
