# Building `swtpcsim` on Windows

**Status (2026-07-15): builds, passes the full test suite, and the win32 platform
layer is field-proven with MSVC.** The `src/platform/win32/` layer was written on
macOS and had never been through a compiler until GitHub Actions CI was added. It now
**builds and links cleanly** on `windows-latest` (MSVC, Winsock via `ws2_32`), **all
registered tests pass** on native Windows, and the socket and terminal
implementations are each proved against the real world by a `ctest -L hw` leg — see §5.

The `0xC0000409` fast-fail that the `unit` aggregate used to hit was a **test**
bug, not a win32-layer one: `test_media.cpp` deleted a temp file while a live
`HostFile` still held it open (POSIX unlinks an open file; Windows refuses and
`fs::remove` threw an uncaught `filesystem_error`), and it also stripped only
`owner_write` to simulate a read-only file, which the C++ filesystem maps to the
Windows read-only attribute *only when every write bit is clear*. Both were fixed
in the test — no `#ifdef` — so the teardown unmounts before it deletes and clears
all the write bits. §6 still describes the fast-loop for the next win32 issue.

There are **no third-party dependencies** — the binary links only against the
system C/C++ runtime and `ws2_32` (Winsock).

**A clean Windows 10 22H2 was taken from nothing to a working build on 2026-07-20** — MSVC Build
Tools, CMake/Ninja and Git installed with only `curl.exe`, then `swtpcsim` built from a plain
PowerShell and the suite run. That walk-through, with the commands and the traps a bare machine
actually has, is **§1.1**.

## 1. Prerequisites

**Yes, the free edition works.** You have two free choices for the MSVC C++20
compiler:

| Option | What it is | Free? |
|---|---|---|
| **Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022** | Command-line MSVC toolchain, **no IDE** — all you need to build from CMake | Free, no conditions |
| **Visual Studio Community 2022** | Full IDE + the same MSVC compiler | Free for individuals, open source, and small orgs |

Either one, from <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/> (Community is on
the main page; Build Tools is lower down under "Tools for Visual Studio"). Pick
Build Tools if you just want to compile; pick Community if you also want the IDE
and its debugger (handy for §6).

In the installer, check the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload. That one
box installs everything needed:

- **MSVC v143** — the x64/x86 C++ compiler (C++20).
- **Windows 11 SDK** (or 10 — either is fine).
- **C++ CMake tools for Windows** — this bundles **CMake** *and* **Ninja**, so you
  usually do **not** need a separate CMake install.

Install **git** too if you don't have it — the installer offers "Git for Windows"
as an individual component, or get it from <https://git-scm.com/download/win>.
Optionally install the **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) from <https://cli.github.com/> for `gh` operations.

| Need | Minimum | Comes from |
|---|---|---|
| C++20 compiler | MSVC v143 (VS 2022) | Desktop development with C++ |
| CMake | ≥ 3.20 | bundled with that workload |
| git | any | Git for Windows |

### 1.1 From a bare machine, scripted — the reproducible route

**Proven end to end on a clean Windows 10 22H2 (build 19045), 2026-07-20.** The GUI installer
above works, but a machine set up by clicking is not reproducible and the next person cannot
tell what you did. This route uses only what a fresh Windows already has, and every step is a
command. **Run these in a normal Windows PowerShell** unless a step says otherwise.

**First, what a clean Windows 10 actually ships with:**

```powershell
[System.Environment]::OSVersion.Version                       # 10.0.19045.0
(Get-ItemProperty 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion').DisplayVersion   # 22H2
Get-Command curl.exe, tar.exe -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue   # BOTH present, in System32
```

`curl.exe` and `tar.exe` have shipped in `System32` since Windows 10 1803, so they are there —
`curl.exe` is the dependable fetcher.

**The MSVC Build Tools — install elevated, unattended.** The installer writes under Program
Files, so it needs administrator rights: open **Windows PowerShell as administrator** for this
one step (the plain 64-bit console — not x86, not ISE).

```powershell
curl.exe -L -o "$env:TEMP\vs_BuildTools.exe" https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe
Start-Process "$env:TEMP\vs_BuildTools.exe" -Wait -ArgumentList `
  '--quiet','--wait','--norestart', `
  '--add','Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.VCTools', `
  '--add','Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.CMake.Project', `
  '--includeRecommended'
"exit: $LASTEXITCODE"    # 0 or 3010 = success
```

`Workload.VCTools` is the C++ compiler and Windows SDK; `VC.CMake.Project` bundles CMake **and**
Ninja. It is a multi-GB download and installs silently for several minutes — `Start-Process
-Wait` blocks until it is genuinely done. Verify it landed (nothing is put on `PATH`, so `where
cl` will fail — that is expected, and §1.1's next step fixes it):

```powershell
$vsw = "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Microsoft Visual Studio\Installer\vswhere.exe"
$vs  = & $vsw -products * -latest -property installationPath
"$vs"                                                    # ...\2022\BuildTools
Get-ChildItem "$vs\VC\Tools\MSVC" | Select-Object Name  # e.g. 14.44.35207
```

**Put CMake and Ninja on your PATH — the step the GUI docs skip.** Build Tools installs them
under the VS tree, not on `PATH`, so a plain shell cannot invoke `cmake` until you add them. Do
it once, persistently (user scope — no admin needed):

```powershell
$mk = "$vs\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake"
$u  = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('Path','User'); if (-not $u) { $u = '' }
foreach ($d in @("$mk\CMake\bin", "$mk\Ninja")) {
  if (($u -split ';') -notcontains $d) { $u = ($u.TrimEnd(';') + ';' + $d) }
}
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('Path', $u.TrimStart(';'), 'User')
```

**Open a new PowerShell** (so it picks up the new PATH), then confirm — no Developer shell, no
`vcvars`:

```powershell
cmake --version    # 3.31.x-msvc...
ninja --version    # 1.12.x
```

**Git for Windows — also scriptable.** This lands `git` *and* Git Bash (the latter
is needed later for `tools/build-package.sh`). Fetch the current 64-bit installer straight from
the project's releases and install it silently (run this elevated too):

```powershell
$rel = curl.exe -sL https://api.github.com/repos/git-for-windows/git/releases/latest | ConvertFrom-Json
$url = ($rel.assets | Where-Object { $_.name -match '64-bit\.exe$' -and $_.name -notmatch 'Portable|Mini|arm' }).browser_download_url
curl.exe -L -o "$env:TEMP\git.exe" $url
Start-Process "$env:TEMP\git.exe" -Wait -ArgumentList '/VERYSILENT','/NORESTART','/SP-','/SUPPRESSMSGBOXES','/NOCANCEL'
```

In a new shell, `git --version` should answer.

**That is the whole toolchain.** Clone and build with §2 — the plain-PowerShell VS-generator
path there is **confirmed** to find MSVC on this exact setup with no Developer shell (§6,
approach A).

---

## 2. Build

**A plain PowerShell is enough — with the default generator.** The Visual Studio
generator invokes MSBuild, which locates the toolchain itself, so `cl.exe` does not
need to be on your `PATH`. CI is the proof: the Windows leg configures with
`shell: bash`, sets up no VS environment at all, and is a required check.

**Where you DO need a *Developer* shell is Ninja** (and NMake), below: those invoke
`cl.exe` directly, and it plus its `INCLUDE`/`LIB` paths only exist inside the VS
environment. From the Start menu open **"Developer PowerShell for VS 2022"** (or
**"x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022"**).

This distinction matters more than it looks: it is what lets the build run
unattended — in a script, or under an assistant — without a shell that has to be
launched a particular way.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/deltecent/swtpcsim
cd swtpcsim
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release --target swtpcsim
```

The default generator on Windows is the **Visual Studio** generator, which is
*multi-config*: you do **not** pass `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`; you choose the config at
build time with `--config Release`. The result is **`build\Release\swtpcsim.exe`**.
This matches exactly what CI does.

> **Prefer a single-config, faster build?** Use Ninja (it ships with the C++ CMake
> tools), which behaves like the Linux/macOS build — `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` at
> configure time, no `Release\` subfolder. **This is the path that needs a Developer
> shell**, because Ninja runs `cl.exe` directly:
> ```powershell
> cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
> cmake --build build --target swtpcsim
> ```
> The binary is then `build\swtpcsim.exe`.

The build compiles with `/W4 /permissive-` and may print warnings; they do not fail the
build. Unlike the GCC and Clang legs, the MSVC leg is **not** yet promoted to warnings-as-errors
by `-DWERROR=on` — `/W4` has a pre-existing backlog to clear first (issue #238), so `/WX` is
deliberately not added here. MSVC warnings stay visible in the log but non-fatal for now.

---

## 3. Smoke test

```powershell
build\Release\swtpcsim.exe --version        # prints "swtpcsim 1.0.0-…"
build\Release\swtpcsim.exe --list           # lists built-in machines (swtpc, altair680)
build\Release\swtpcsim.exe -x "help" swtpc   # boots the SWTPC 6800, runs one command, exits
build\Release\swtpcsim.exe                  # interactive: the default machine's monitor + console
```

`--list` succeeding confirms the embedded machines and ROMs load; `-x "help"
swtpc` confirms a machine actually initializes.

---

## 4. Running the tests

```powershell
ctest --test-dir build -C Release -LE slow --output-on-failure
```

- **`expect` is not on Windows**, so the interactive acceptance tests
  (`acceptance-cli` and the machine-boot oracles `acceptance-altair680`,
  `acceptance-altair680-kcacr`, `acceptance-flex`) do not register — they
  self-skip at configure time. That is expected and does not fail the build.
- **The `-L hw` leg** (`socket-hw`, `terminal-hw`) touches the real world.
  `socket-hw` always runs — it drives the host's kernel TCP stack over a loopback
  port and needs no external hardware. `terminal-hw` takes over the real console;
  without one it can take it exits 77 and is reported `Skipped`. A `Skipped`
  result there is **expected — it does not fail the build**, and the exit-77 skip
  means an absent console never reads as a false green. Run the leg explicitly to
  exercise the console — both are described in §5:
  ```powershell
  ctest --test-dir build -C Release -L hw --output-on-failure
  ```

Everything that registers passes. If a new win32 problem crashes the `unit`
aggregate with `0xC0000409`, §6 shows how to isolate it.

---

## 5. What is verified so far

- **Compiles and links** on `windows-latest` (MSVC, CI). The win32 serial, socket,
  and terminal implementations build; `CMakeLists.txt` links `ws2_32` for Winsock.
- **All registered tests pass** (the ones that register without `expect`/disk
  images), including the `unit` aggregate now that its teardown bug is fixed.
- **The win32 platform layer is field-proven** (a pre-rename record, 2026-07-15 —
  the same POSIX/win32 layer swtpcsim inherits). `ctest -L hw` is the real-world
  leg, and both label-`hw` tests pass on native Windows:
  - **socket-hw** — the real kernel TCP stack, 11 checks: non-blocking connect
    (success, bytes both ways, hangup) and the **refused** connect that lands in
    `select()`'s except set, the flagged Winsock case.
  - **terminal-hw** — a real console, 15 checks: `enterTermMode` through both modes
    (Guest clears line-input/echo/`PROCESSED_INPUT`; LineEdit leaves `PROCESSED_INPUT`
    as found, so Ctrl-C still signals), `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT` set, and an
    exact, idempotent `restoreTerm`. Skips (77) where no console can be taken. (The
    terminal *pipe* path — `readInput` + broken-pipe EOF — is covered by the
    acceptance suite; the peek-and-discard loop is verified by hand, being too racy
    against the shared console buffer to commit — see `docs/porting-notes.md`.)

  ```powershell
  ctest --test-dir build -C Release -L hw --output-on-failure
  ```

  **`terminal-hw` will show as *Failed* under `ctest`, and that is a test-harness
  artifact, not a layer bug** (observed 2026-07-20). `ctest` captures a child's stdout
  through a pipe, so `stdoutIsTty()` is false — and the test's skip logic keys only on
  *stdin*, so with a console stdin but a piped stdout it runs the suite and fails the one
  `stdoutIsTty()` check (the other 14 pass). Run the executable **directly**, with stdout
  on the real console, to see the true result:

  ```powershell
  .\build\Release\swtpc_terminaltest.exe    # 15 checks, 0 failed, exit 0
  ```

  So on a routine `ctest --test-dir build -C Release -LE slow`, expect `terminal-hw`
  reported failed; confirm the layer with the direct run above. Making the test *skip*
  when stdout alone is redirected is an open task.

---

## 6. The three Windows build approaches (only Ninja + `vcvars` still unverified)

> **Approach A is now SETTLED — it works (Windows 10 22H2, 2026-07-20).** A plain
> (non-Developer) PowerShell, `cmake -S . -B build` with the default Visual Studio generator,
> found the Build Tools MSVC on its own:
> `-- Building for: Visual Studio 17 2022` / `The CXX compiler identification is MSVC
> 19.44.35228.0` / `Check for working CXX compiler: ...\BuildTools\...\cl.exe - skipped`. The
> full build produced `swtpcsim.exe` and `ctest -LE slow` passed 16/17 (the 17th being the
> `terminal-hw` harness artifact in §5). The scripted setup that got there is §1.1.
> **Approach C is settled end to end (same machine, 2026-07-20).**
> `tools\build-sdl3-static.bat` ran on its first outing, exit 0, and produced a 13 MB
> `SDL3-static.lib` with no stray `SDL3.dll`. Built against it with
> `-DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreaded`, `swtpcsim.exe` came out **windowed**
> (`video SDL3 -- windowed`), **4.2 MB, and self-contained** — `dumpbin /dependents` shows no
> `SDL3.dll` and, crucially, **no `VCRUNTIME140.dll`/`MSVCP140.dll`, so the static CRT
> propagated through SDL and no VC++ redistributable is needed.** `ctest -LE slow` passed 16/17
> (the `terminal-hw` harness artifact in §5). **And the packaging ran too:**
> `tools/build-package.sh` under Git Bash, exit 0, produced a 3.8 MB `.zip` — Git Bash ships no
> `zip`, so it fell to `powershell.exe Compress-Archive` (the middle of the fallback chain), and
> the Git-Bash-path-meets-PowerShell translation was a non-issue. The archive name came out clean
> (the MSVC-CRLF strip held), and the linkage check printed its "cannot check on this host — run
> `dumpbin`" note without blocking. Unpacked outside the repository the shipped `swtpcsim.exe`
> is self-contained (only system DLLs) and **launches a built-in machine** from it.
> **And the human video checks passed** (`DISTRIBUTION.md` §7): the SDL3 windowed path
> opened a real window in the VMware guest, with keyboard into the window and the
> close-while-running behaviour exercised. (The software booted and the specific board
> windowed in that pre-rename run were swtpcsim's — the win32/SDL3 pipeline is what was
> proven, and it is what swtpcsim inherits.) **The whole pipeline, bare machine to a window
> on screen, has run here.**
> **Approach B (Ninja + chained `vcvars`) remains untried** — the VS generator has carried
> every build so far, so nothing has needed it.

**This section is a job, not a description** — but most of it is now discharged. Of the three
approaches it lists, **A and C are settled** (A on 2026-07-20; C's `build-sdl3-static.bat`
re-verified from scratch on 2026-07-22 — exit 0 in ~3.5 min, valid `SDL3-static.lib` — see the
note above and `DISTRIBUTION.md` §8). **Only approach B (Ninja + chained `vcvars`) remains
untried.** The commands to settle it, and how to report back, follow. **If you are an assistant
on the Windows box, approach B is the work that is left.**

Why it matters: an unattended build — a script, or an assistant — cannot rely on a shell
that has to be launched from the Start menu. And **an assistant's environment does not
survive between commands**: the working directory carries over, but environment variables
do not, so `call vcvars64.bat` in one command and `cmake` in the next starts clean. Each
approach below is a different way around that.

### First: set the session up correctly, or the answers will be wrong

**Use native Windows, not WSL.** The MSVC toolchain is a Windows-native tool and is not
visible from inside WSL. WSL is the better choice for a Linux toolchain and is the only one
that supports sandboxing, but it cannot build this the way we ship it.

**Launch from a PLAIN PowerShell, not a "Developer PowerShell for VS 2022."** Two reasons,
and the second is the one that bites:

1. Approach A below asks *"does this work without a Developer shell?"* Testing it from a
   Developer shell answers a different question and reports a false pass.
2. **It would not help anyway.** Claude Code does **not** inherit environment variables from
   the terminal that launched it — each command runs in a fresh process. Whatever
   `vcvars64.bat` set in your launching shell is gone by the time a build command runs. There
   is no "set it up once at the top" option.

**Know which shell you will actually get, because it changes the syntax below.** With Git for
Windows installed, Claude Code uses **Git Bash**; without it, **PowerShell**. There is also a
PowerShell tool rolling out progressively, which is the better fit for this project — it runs
Windows commands natively with no wrapper. To ask for it, before launching:

```json
// .claude/settings.json  (or settings.local.json)
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL": "1" } }
```

**The commands in this section are written in PowerShell.** If you end up on Git Bash, they
still work but need wrapping — `cmd /c "…"` or `powershell -Command "…"` — and the quoting is
fussy: double-quote the whole Windows command and mind that backslashes survive. Say in your
report which shell you had, because it changes what the commands mean.

*(If you later want Ninja to work without chaining `vcvars` into every command, the supported
route is `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` or a `SessionStart` hook to populate the environment per command —
not a specially-launched terminal. Out of scope for settling the three questions below.)*

### The three approaches to settle

**A. MSVC + Visual Studio generator — believed to need NO setup at all.**
Strongly evidenced but not confirmed interactively: CI's Windows leg configures with
`shell: bash`, no workflow contains a `vcvars` step, and it is a required check that
passes. Run this from a **plain** PowerShell — *not* a Developer one:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build --config Release --target swtpcsim
build\Release\swtpcsim.exe --version
```

**B. MSVC + Ninja — needs `vcvars`, chained into the same command.**
Ninja runs `cl.exe` directly, so the environment must exist *within* the one invocation.
Adjust the path to your VS edition:

```powershell
cmd /c "call ""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"" && cmake -S . -B build-ninja -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release && cmake --build build-ninja --target swtpcsim"
```

**C. `tools\build-sdl3-static.bat` — VERIFIED (2026-07-20; re-run from scratch 2026-07-22).**
It pins SDL3 3.4.12, builds it static into `%USERPROFILE%\opt\sdl3-static`, and is a no-op
on a second run. Needs only CMake — `curl.exe` and `tar.exe` ship with Windows 10 1803+. Both
paths are confirmed on Windows 10 / MSVC 2022 Build Tools: the from-scratch build produces a
13 MB `SDL3-static.lib` (plus headers and `cmake/SDL3Config.cmake`) in ~3.5 min, and the
idempotent "already installed 3.4.12" path works. The commands below are the record of what ran.

```powershell
tools\build-sdl3-static.bat
# then, against the prefix it reports:
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="$env:USERPROFILE\opt\sdl3-static" `
      -DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY=MultiThreaded
cmake --build build --config Release --target swtpcsim
```

**The CRT setting must match between the two.** The script builds SDL3 with the static CRT
(`/MT`) so the finished `.exe` needs no VC++ redistributable; if `swtpcsim` is built without
that flag it gets `/MD`, and mixing them gives duplicate-symbol link errors or two separate C
runtime heaps. If you change it, change it in both places.

Verify it took (**confirmed on Windows 10 22H2, 2026-07-20** — the values below are what a good
build actually produced):

- `dumpbin /dependents build\Release\swtpcsim.exe` — must list **no `SDL3.dll`** (SDL is
  static) and **no `VCRUNTIME140.dll` / `MSVCP140.dll`** (the CRT is static, so the package
  needs no VC++ redistributable). What it *should* list is only system DLLs — `KERNEL32`,
  `USER32`, `GDI32`, `WINMM`, `IMM32`, `ole32`, `OLEAUT32`, `VERSION`, `ADVAPI32`, `SETUPAPI`,
  `SHELL32`, `WS2_32` — all present on every Windows. That was the whole `dumpbin` output on a
  4.2 MB self-contained `swtpcsim.exe`.
- `swtpcsim.exe -n -x "SHOW VERSION"` — must show `video  SDL3 -- windowed`. **This, not
  symbols, is what distinguishes a static-windowed build from a headless one**, because both
  lack `SDL3.dll`.

**Do NOT use `dumpbin /symbols … | findstr SDL_`.** On a *linked release* `.exe` the COFF symbol
table is empty — the symbols are in the PDB — so that check finds **nothing on a good build**
(observed: 0 matches). It works on the static `.lib`, not the `.exe`. And `strings` is no good
either: `SDL_CreateWindow` is a symbol, not a string literal.

### What to record

For **each** of A, B and C, capture four things. Partial results are worth reporting;
"A works, C fails at the configure step" is a useful answer.

1. The **exact command** you ran, and from what kind of shell (plain PowerShell, Developer
   PowerShell, `cmd`).
2. Whether configure printed **`-- SDL3 found -- video boards enabled (windowed)`** or the
   `not found` line. Quote it.
3. The **first** error in full, if it failed. Not a summary — the actual text.
4. `build\...\swtpcsim.exe --version` output, and `ctest --test-dir build -C Release -LE slow`
   pass line, if you got that far.

Fill this in, replacing every `?`:

```
shell Claude actually used : ?   (Git Bash / PowerShell tool / PowerShell fallback)
launched from             : ?   (plain PowerShell / other -- should be plain)

approach A (MSVC + VS generator, no env setup)  : PASS / FAIL  ?
approach B (MSVC + Ninja, chained vcvars)       : PASS / FAIL  ?
approach C (build-sdl3-static.bat)              : PASS / FAIL  ?

VS edition + version : ?
SDL3 found by A/B    : ?
C: SDL3-static.lib produced?             : ?
C: swtpcsim links it, no SDL3.dll?      : ?
commands needed rewriting for the shell? : ?
first error, if any  : ?
```

### How to report it back

**Preferred — put it in the repository, so the answer outlives the conversation.** From
the Windows box:

```powershell
git checkout -b windows/env-findings
# edit THIS section: replace the block above with what actually happened,
# and correct any command that was wrong
git commit -am "Record what actually works for a Windows build without a Developer shell"
git push -u origin windows/env-findings
```

**Do not merge it to `master` yourself** — push the branch and say so. Findings that
contradict this file are the most valuable kind and want reading before they land.

**Also paste the filled-in block into the conversation on the Mac.** The branch is the
durable record; the paste is what lets the next step happen without waiting on a review.

**If an approach fails, say so and stop.** A failure here is information — this section
exists precisely because nobody knows the answer. Do not work around it silently, and do
not "fix" the build to make an approach succeed; that turns an unknown into a different
unknown.

Once settled: this section shrinks to a statement of fact and moves into §5, and
`DISTRIBUTION.md` §4.4 gets corrected.

---

## 7. Debugging the win32 layer locally (the fast loop)

CI shows *that* something fails but not *where* — it can only give one MSVC error at
a time and can't attach a debugger. A native Windows box with the toolchain above
gives the same fast compile → run → fix loop we already have on macOS/Linux, and
lets you run the crashing binary under a debugger.

**This is also why running Claude Code on Windows helps:** with MSVC + CMake
installed, open this repo in Claude Code on the Windows machine and it can build and
debug `src/platform/win32/` directly, instead of pushing to CI and waiting.

To isolate a `unit` crash, run the test binary directly so you can see which
sub-test prints last before it dies (unbuffering `stdout` first, so the last line
survives the fast-fail, is what pinned down the `test_media` one):

```powershell
cmake --build build --config Debug --target swtpc_tests   # Debug = better diagnostics
build\Debug\swtpc_tests.exe                               # last line before the crash names the area
```

A Debug build trips the runtime's checks with a readable message and, if VS is
installed, offers to attach the debugger at the fault — which points straight at the
offending line. (Under WinDbg/VS, `0xC0000409` breaks at the `__fastfail` site.)

> **WSL will not help here.** WSL is Linux: it builds `src/platform/posix/`, not the
> win32 code, so it would give a green build that never touched the files under
> repair. The bring-up must happen on **native** Windows with MSVC.

---

## 8. The §2.1 rule still applies on Windows

Do **not** fix a Windows problem by adding an `#ifdef _WIN32` (or any OS header) to
shared code in `src/` or `tests/`. The `platform_lint` target (DESIGN.md §2.1) runs
as a build dependency and scans `tests/` too — an OS macro or header outside
`src/platform/` **fails the build**. OS-specific code goes in `src/platform/win32/`;
everything else stays platform-agnostic. (This is why the MSVC `strncasecmp` fix in
`tests/cputest.cpp` is a macro-free `<cctype>` helper rather than an `#ifdef`.)

## 9. The MinGW + `make` convenience build (NOT for releases)

There is a plain `Makefile` at the repository root that builds the `swtpcsim`
binary with nothing but `make` and a C++20 `g++` — the SIMH way, from an ordinary
Windows command prompt, no CMake and no Developer shell. It exists for people who
build that way; **it is a convenience, not the supported build.**

> **MSVC + CMake is the only supported Windows toolchain, and the only one a
> release is ever built with** (`DISTRIBUTION.md`). The Makefile builds the binary
> and nothing else — no tests, no reference-doc generation, no packaging. Use §2
> for anything you intend to ship.

**Verified on 2026-07-28** — Windows 10 22H2, a standalone **WinLibs MinGW-w64
GCC 16.1.0 (UCRT)** on `PATH`, from a plain `cmd` (no MSYS2, no Developer shell):
`mingw32-make` produced a self-contained `swtpcsim.exe` that lists every built-in machine
and boots, and its embedded ROMs/machines came out byte-identical to the CMake build.

```bat
mingw32-make
build-make\swtpcsim.exe --version
build-make\swtpcsim.exe --list
```

The binary and all intermediates land in **`build-make\`** — deliberately not in
`build\`, which is the CMake build's, so the two never collide.

- **Toolchain:** **MinGW-w64 with GCC 11 or newer** (verified with GCC 16.1.0) and
  `mingw32-make`. A standalone install works fine — e.g. **WinLibs** (winlibs.com):
  unzip, put its `bin` on PATH, done. No MSYS2 required. **Classic MinGW.org and
  GCC 9/10 will not build this** — their C++20 support is incomplete (GCC 9 does not
  even accept `-std=c++20`), so grab a modern MinGW-w64 instead. The Makefile checks
  the compiler's version up front and stops with a clear message if it is too old,
  rather than failing later in a confusing way.
- **OS is detected from the `%OS%` environment variable** (`Windows_NT`), so it
  needs no `uname` and works from a bare `cmd`. Recipes use `cmd` builtins (guarded
  `mkdir`, `del`/`rmdir`) — no `sh`. It links `-lws2_32 -lwinmm` → `swtpcsim.exe`.
- **The exe is self-contained.** The Windows build links `-static`, so the MinGW
  runtime (`libstdc++`, `libgcc`, `libwinpthread`) is baked in and `swtpcsim.exe`
  runs on any Windows without the toolchain's `bin` on PATH. (Want the DLL-linked
  build instead? `mingw32-make LDFLAGS=`.)
- **It builds headless by default on Windows** (null display). SDL3 is not
  auto-detected here — pkg-config is rarely present under MinGW. For a windowed
  build, point it at your SDL3 by hand:
  ```bat
  mingw32-make SDL=1 SDL_CFLAGS=-IC:/SDL3/include SDL_LIBS="-LC:/SDL3/lib -lSDL3"
  ```
- **`mingw32-make help`** prints what it detected (OS, SDL, CUPS) and the switches
  (`NO_SDL=1`, `CXX=...`, `CXXFLAGS=...`).

**How it stays CMake-free.** CMake generates three source files at build time
(the embedded ROMs, the embedded machines and a version header). The Makefile
reproduces them **byte-for-byte** with a tiny bootstrap generator, `tools/embed.cpp`,
that it compiles first and then runs — the SIMH `sim_BuildROMs.c` pattern. On a
machine that also has a CMake `build/`, `make check-gen` proves the two match.

The same `Makefile` builds on Linux and macOS; see `docs/building-linux.md` §8.
