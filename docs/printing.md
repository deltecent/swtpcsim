# Printing to a real printer

**Status: Phase 1 built (CUPS: macOS + Linux).** The `printer:` endpoint, its
buffering and job boundaries, and the CUPS submit backend are shipped and covered by
tests; the User Manual's serial chapter now documents the operator side. Still open
(later branches): the explicit operator verb (`PRINT FLUSH` / `EJECT`, §2.2) and the
Windows WinSpool backend (§3). Discussion and the remaining open questions live on
[issue #70](https://github.com/deltecent/swtpcsim/issues/70); this document is the
detail behind it, and the record of the design calls it made.

Three things this note called wrong were corrected when it was built, and the
corrections are folded into the sections below: the CMake detection is
`find_package(Cups)`, **not** pkg-config (§3.1); the platform backends live in
`src/platform/`, **not** `src/host/` (§3.1); and a machine **reset is not a job
boundary** (§2.1).

The want: a guest program prints, and paper comes out of a printer attached to
this host. Before this, the only destinations for printed bytes were `file:PATH` and
`null` — a capture, not a printout.

---

## 1. Where this belongs: the endpoint, not the board

The instinct is to make printing a property of the board that drives the printer
line — a parallel PIA port, say, since a parallel port is what a printer of the
era plugged into. That would be wrong, and expensively so.

A printer is something on the far end of a line, and `src/host/stream.h` is
emphatic about what that means: a board knows it has a line and must never
learn what is on the other end of it. The endpoint grammar lives in exactly one
place (`resolveEndpoint`, `src/host/endpoint.cpp`) and no board parses an
endpoint string. That is why `CONNECT uio0:p1a serial:/dev/tty.usbserial-AL009KFH`
needed not one line of code in the UIO board.

So printing is a new `ByteStream`, `printer:QUEUE`, added to the resolver — and
every board that can put a byte on a line gets it the day it lands, with no
board changed:

- the **MP-B/UIO** parallel PIA ports (`src/boards/mits-680uio.cpp`), so
  `CONNECT uio0:p1a printer:linewriter` sends a parallel printer's bytes to a host
  queue — the closest thing the 6800 world has to a Centronics port
- the **MP-S serial** console (`src/boards/swtpc-mps.cpp`), because a serial
  printer was as ordinary as a parallel one and an operator will want
  `CONNECT mps0:tty printer:linewriter`
- the **680 IO** serial (`src/boards/mits-680io.cpp`), the same day
- any parallel or serial board written next year — an MP-L/MP-LA printer
  interface, when it is built — for free

This is the same argument the `Display` seam settled and the same one
`ByteStream` was built to settle. Making it a board property would mean writing
it again for the UIO's parallel ports, again for the MP-S serial, again for the
next board — implementations that would drift.

**Read-only, in the other direction.** A printer is write-only: `read()` returns
0 forever and `readable()` is false. That is not a special case; it is what
`NullStream` already does, and a card wired to a printer polling for input finds
a quiet line, exactly as it would on the bench.

---

## 2. The hard part: when is the job finished?

Centronics has no end-of-job signal. Neither does a serial line. The guest
writes bytes and stops writing bytes, and stopping is not an event — this is a
real property of the hardware, not a gap in the emulation. A real line printer
resolved it mechanically: the paper was continuous, and the operator tore it
off.

A host print queue cannot work that way. It wants a *job*: a finite blob handed
over once. So something has to decide where one printout ends and the next
begins.

### 2.1 The idle timer (the proposal)

Buffer the bytes. Every byte written restarts a timer. When the timer expires
with no further byte, close the buffer and submit it as one job.

This is right because it matches what the guest actually does — a program
prints a report, then goes back to the user — and because it needs no
cooperation from guest software that was written in 1977 and cannot be changed.

Three things follow from it, and each is a finding, not a detail:

**The timer must run on WALL time, not the Clock.** The default clock is
free-running (`clock_hz = 0`), so emulated seconds have no fixed relation to
real ones; a five-second emulated timeout could fire in eighty milliseconds, or
never. The test the repo already uses is *can a guest read it back* — and it
cannot read this, because no register exposes it. It is the host's dwell time
before it gives up waiting for more paper. So it belongs on host seconds, like
a display's cursor blink (`Display::hostSeconds()`, `src/host/display.h`), and not
on the Clock. Getting this backwards is the exact mistake that makes any
host-timed effect strobe when it is wrongly hung on the Clock.

**`pump()` stops when the guest stops.** `Machine::pump()` is called from the run
loop and the monitor's other pump points (`src/cli/monitor.cpp`). A timer ticked only
from `pump()` would never fire if the guest halts, breakpoints, or the operator
hits ATTN right after printing — the commonest case of all, since a program that
just finished a report is often a program that just finished. The buffer must
therefore also be submitted on `DISCONNECT`, on `CONFIG LOAD` (which replaces the
machine wholesale), and at exit. As built, all three are the **stream's
destructor**: DISCONNECT swaps in a `NullStream` and destroys the old stream, and
CONFIG LOAD and exit destroy the boards and their streams — so one `noexcept`
destructor submit covers every teardown path with no board changed. The idle timer
is the *usual* boundary, not the only one. `MediaFile::commit()` is the precedent:
the thing that guarantees the bytes land is not the thing that usually pushes them.

**Reset is not a boundary** (correction to an earlier draft of this note). A warm
reset keeps the line connected — a real reset does not unplug the printer — and a
parallel printer's INIT strobe is a *start*-of-job, not an end (§2.2). Submitting on reset would chop
an in-flight report the moment a guest reboots and resumes printing. A reset that is
followed by a halt forever is already covered by the destructor at exit, so nothing
is lost by leaving reset alone.

**`flush()` is already taken and cannot mean end-of-job.** `ByteStream::flush()`
means "push what you are holding down the pipe", and the UIO calls it on *every
pump* (`src/boards/mits-680uio.cpp:154`) so a capture file is visible while the
machine runs. If `flush()` submitted a job, every idle slice would submit an
empty one. The job boundary needs its own name inside the printer stream; it
must not ride on `flush()`.

### 2.2 The other boundaries, and which are worth having

- **A form feed (`0x0C`)** is the closest thing the era had to "page done". It
  is a plausible boundary and a bad default: a multi-page report is one job, and
  splitting it makes N jobs that interleave with everyone else's on a shared
  queue. Offer it as an option (`onff`), do not assume it.
- **A parallel printer's INIT strobe** — the control line a PIA port pulses to
  reset the printer and home the head — resets the printer and homes the head. It
  is a *start*-of-job signal, not an end: it is what a program sends before it
  prints, not after. Treating it as a boundary would submit the previous job at
  the right time only by accident.
- **An explicit operator verb** — something like `PRINT FLUSH` or
  `EJECT <board>` — should exist regardless. When the timer is set long, or the
  guest is paused mid-report, the operator needs a way to say "send it now"
  without disconnecting the line.

### 2.3 The parameters

**Settled (Patrick, 2026-07-19): the parameters go in the endpoint spec**, not
in `SET` properties on the board's unit. The spec is the resolver's business and
the resolver is the only thing permitted to know this grammar; putting them on
the unit would hand every board a printer-shaped property it has no business
having, and would need adding again to the next card. In the spec they also
round-trip for free — `describe()` returns what the operator typed, and that is
what `SHOW` prints and `CONFIG SAVE` writes back.

```
printer:QUEUE[?key[=value][&key[=value]...]]
```

**A boolean key may be written bare**: `?onff` means on, and an unmentioned key
keeps its default, so the common case never types `=1`. The `=value` form still
parses, and that is deliberate rather than redundant — it is the only way to
write *off*, which matters because whether `onff` should default on is an open
question (§2.2). If that answer ever flips, a bare-only grammar could not
express the other state and would have to change under specs people had already
written. One branch in the parser buys the door staying open: a token with no
`=` is `=true`, otherwise the value goes to `parseValue`.

| Name | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `idle` | Host seconds of silence that end a job. `0` = never; the verb is the only boundary. | 5 |
| `onff` | Also end a job on a form feed (`0x0C`). | `false` |
| `max` | Byte ceiling on one job, so a runaway loop cannot eat memory. | a large finite number |

```
CONNECT uio0:p1a printer:linewriter
CONNECT uio0:p1a printer:linewriter?idle=15
CONNECT uio0:p1a printer:linewriter?onff
CONNECT mps0:tty "printer:Generic / Text Only?idle=0&onff"
```

**Parse the values with `parseValue`, not by hand.** Where a value *is* given,
the tree already has exactly one answer for what a boolean may be written as
(`parseValue`, `src/core/value.cpp:138`): `true`/`yes`/`on`/`1` and
`false`/`no`/`off`/`0`, case-insensitively, displayed always as `true`/`false`.
Calling it here means `onff=on`, `onff=1` and `onff=YES` all work and mean the
same thing as everywhere else in the simulator, and `idle` gets the same
radix-aware number parsing every other integer property gets. A hand-rolled
parser that accepted only `1` would be a second convention for no gain, and the
operator would find it by having a spelling rejected that works fine three
commands earlier.

`describe()` should print the bare form for a true boolean, so what `SHOW` and
`CONFIG SAVE` show is what a person would have typed.

**The three boundaries compose; they are not alternatives.** `idle`, `onff` and
`max` are independent, OR'd, and the first to fire ends the job. `idle=5&onff=1`
means a form feed ends the page at once *and* a report that simply stops is
still submitted five seconds later. `idle=0&onff=1` means the form feed is the
only automatic boundary — which is the right setting for a driver that emits
one, and is unreachable if the two are treated as exclusive.

That composition carries one hazard, and it is worth building for on the first
day: **an empty buffer must never submit.** A form feed closes the job, and the
idle timer then expires a few seconds later with nothing in hand. If that
submits, every printout is followed by a blank job — silent, and diagnosed only
by someone standing at the printer counting blank pages. Every boundary checks
that there is something to send.

Three more consequences to build to:

- **`?` is the separator, not `:`.** `socket:HOST:PORT` already spends the colon,
  and a queue name may contain one. `?` and `&` cannot appear in a CUPS queue
  name and are vanishingly unlikely in a Windows printer name, so the split is
  unambiguous: first `?` ends the queue name, everything after is
  `&`-separated `key=value`.
- **A Windows queue name can contain spaces** — `Generic / Text Only` is the
  driver this document tells people to install. The monitor splits a command
  line on whitespace, so either the operator quotes the spec or the name is
  unreachable. Whichever way that lands, it must be settled when this is built
  and not discovered by someone whose printer will not connect.
- **An unknown key is an error, with the list.** `printer:lw?idel=10` must say so
  and name the four it could have meant. The resolver never guesses — that rule
  is already written down in `endpoint.h`, and a silently ignored typo here
  means jobs that never come out and no clue why.

---

## 3. Reaching the printer on each host

Both target platforms fall into two implementation families, not three.

- **Windows** — talk to the Print Spooler directly through the **WinSpool API**
  (`OpenPrinter` / `StartDocPrinter` / `WritePrinter`), submitting with datatype
  `"RAW"`. This bypasses driver-level reformatting and delivers the bytes
  untouched.
- **macOS and Linux** — both sit on **CUPS**. One implementation over the CUPS C
  API (`cupsPrintFile2`) covers both, provided the destination queue is created
  as a **raw** queue (no PPD, no filters).

USB Centronics printers appear as ordinary printer queues on all three OSes
(through a USB-to-parallel adapter, or a built-in USB port on a newer line
printer). None of them expose the printer as a raw character device that can be
opened portably, so going through the OS's queue mechanism forced into
raw/passthrough mode is both the most portable route and the correct one.

### 3.1 Files and CMake wiring

As built, the files are (the pure buffering stream is separate from the platform
backend, and is always compiled so its boundary policy is tested with no CUPS):

- `src/host/printer_stream.{h,cpp}` — the buffering `PrinterStream` (job boundaries,
  the never-submit-empty rule). Pure, always compiled.
- `src/platform/printer.h` — the shared submit interface (`printRaw`,
  `printRawFile`, `listQueues`), a sibling of `platform/serial.h`.
- `src/platform/posix/printer_cups.cpp` — CUPS (macOS + Linux).
- `src/platform/win32/printer_windows.cpp` — WinSpool (Phase 3, not yet written).

**The backends live in `src/platform/`, not `src/host/`** (correction to an earlier
draft). The WinSpool one needs `<windows.h>`, which `cmake/lint_platform.cmake`
forbids outside `src/platform/*/` — a build-failing lint. Both backends therefore sit
under `src/platform/{posix,win32}/` behind the shared interface, exactly like
`serial.h`/`socket.h`.

```cmake
option(SWTPCSIM_ENABLE_PRINTER "Print to a host queue if CUPS/WinSpool is found" ON)
if(SWTPCSIM_ENABLE_PRINTER)
  if(WIN32)
    # Phase 3 -- printer_windows.cpp (WinSpool) not yet written.
  else()
    find_package(Cups QUIET)          # CMake's own FindCups -> the Cups::Cups target
    if(Cups_FOUND)
      target_sources(swtpc_core PRIVATE src/platform/posix/printer_cups.cpp)
      target_link_libraries(swtpc_core PUBLIC Cups::Cups)
      target_compile_definitions(swtpc_core PUBLIC SWTPCSIM_ENABLE_PRINTER)
    endif()
  endif()
endif()
```

**`find_package(Cups)`, not pkg-config** (correction to an earlier draft). An earlier
version of this note used `find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)` + `pkg_check_modules`.
That is wrong twice: `pkg-config` is not guaranteed on a macOS dev box (the reference
Mac has `cups-config`, not `pkg-config`), and CMake already ships a `FindCups` module
with an imported `Cups::Cups` target (since 3.15). It also must be **optional**, and
`REQUIRED` fought that: CUPS headers are not guaranteed on a build host — a Linux CI
runner without `libcups2-dev` would stop configuring, breaking a build that works
today over a feature nobody asked that leg to test. So it follows the SDL3 precedent
exactly: an `SWTPCSIM_ENABLE_PRINTER` option defaulting to ON meaning *use it if it
is here*, a quiet detect, a `message(STATUS)` either way, and a build without it where
`printer:` is simply not in `endpointHelp()` and the resolver says so by name. The one
endpoint that cannot work on a given host fails at `CONNECT` with a sentence, not at
compile.

### 3.2 One-time queue setup

Configuring the queue is an install-time admin step. The application assumes a
queue that passes data through untouched and should not try to create one.

**Windows**

1. Install the printer with the **Generic / Text Only** driver, attached to the
   USB port the adapter enumerates as.
2. Use the exact name from **Devices and Printers** as the queue name. Sharing
   is not required — `OpenPrinter` addresses it by device name directly.

**Linux (CUPS)** — a real printer, on a USB-to-parallel adapter or a newer line
printer's own USB port:

```sh
lpinfo -v                                               # what CUPS can see
sudo lpadmin -p linewriter -E -v usb://Vendor/Product -m raw
```

`-m raw` selects the "Raw Queue" model, so CUPS skips all filtering and the bytes
written are delivered as-is. (`printer:` also asks for raw per job, belt and braces.)

**macOS — prefer `socket:` over a CUPS queue, and do not build a bridge.** Apple's
CUPS is backing out of raw host printing in two steps, and both showed up the moment
this was tried on a current Mac. Raw queues are gone now — `lpadmin: Raw queues are no
longer supported on macOS`, so `-m raw` is refused. And the classic driver/PPD
mechanism is deprecated next — any `.ppd` queue prints `lpadmin: Printer drivers are
deprecated and will stop working in a future version of CUPS` — in favour of driverless
IPP Everywhere, which is a poor fit for a *raw* line-printer socket. A macOS-specific
CUPS workaround would be built on exactly the mechanism the platform is deleting, so it
is not worth writing: negative-value engineering, cost now for breakage later.

The durable macOS answer needs no CUPS queue at all. For any network-capable printer,
or a print server fronting a parallel one, swtpcsim's own `socket:` endpoint sends the
raw bytes straight to the JetDirect/AppSocket port:

```
CONNECT uio0:p1a socket:printer-host:9100
```

No drivers, no deprecation, the same 8-bit-clean stream the CUPS path would have
delivered — this is the recommended route on macOS. `printer:` over CUPS is still the
right endpoint on **Linux** (`-m raw`, unaffected) and against a print server, and it
remains correct on macOS wherever the host still lets a raw job through; there is just
no reason to wire a macOS-only CUPS bridge for it. `printer:` submits a correct raw job
on every platform regardless — what a locked-down CUPS does with it is the host's call,
not the endpoint's.

**`socket:` delivers during a RUN; `printer:` delivers on DISCONNECT.** These two are
not interchangeable for how you drive them, and the difference is in the transport. A
`socket:` call-out only sends once the TCP connection is *established*, and that is
advanced in `pump()` — which runs only inside the run loop (`host/tcp.cpp`). So
`socket:` is right for a **real guest program printing while the machine runs**, but
bytes you write by hand to the port's data register (`DEPOSIT`) at the monitor prompt
sit unsent until a `RUN`. `printer:` is the opposite: its job is submitted synchronously
at a boundary, and `DISCONNECT` flushes it there and then — so it is the one you can
drive **by hand** from the prompt. For a bench poke-test, reach for `printer:`; for a
booted FLEX or a guest program that prints, either works and `socket:` is cleaner.

*Confirmed on real hardware.* A page reading `SWTPCSIM` came out of a Brother
MFC-L5700DW laser (a modern AirPrint printer, but with an open JetDirect port and
PCL/Epson-FX/text auto-emulation) via a raw CUPS queue at its socket port:

```sh
sudo lpadmin -p brother_raw -E -v socket://192.0.2.234:9100 \
             -m drv:///sample.drv/generic.ppd -o printer-is-shared=false   # your printer's IP

```

Then `CONNECT uio0:p1a printer:brother_raw`, print the text, and end with a form feed
(deposit `$0C` to the port's data register, or let `?onff` do it) so the printer ejects the page — a raw laser holds
the last page until a form feed or end-of-job tells it the page is done. The printer
must be in its Auto (or a text/PCL) emulation, which is the factory default.

**Bench test only (the deprecated path), for watching the boundaries with no paper.**
To exercise the CUPS submit path on a macOS box *today*, accepting both warnings above,
a nominal generic PPD stands in for the removed raw queue, and the `socket` backend
plus `nc` shows exactly what reaches the device:

```sh
sudo lpadmin -p swtpcterm -E -v socket://localhost:9100 \
             -m drv:///sample.drv/generic.ppd -o printer-is-shared=false   # Linux: -m raw
nc -k -l 9100          # in one terminal: every job's bytes stream here as it lands
```

Then `CONNECT uio0:p1a printer:swtpcterm?idle=3`, print, and `DISCONNECT uio0:p1a` to
flush at once (the destructor submits synchronously, so no run loop is needed). Each
closed job arrives in the `nc` terminal as its own burst — the job-boundary policy made
visible, and the check for whether the raw job survived filtering: clean bytes mean
passthrough, a PostScript wrapper means the host filtered it anyway. `nc -k` keeps
listening across jobs (the `socket` backend opens one connection per job). Remove the
queue with `sudo lpadmin -x swtpcterm`. On Linux this is the same recipe with `-m raw`
and no deprecation attached.

### 3.3 `print_raw`, both platforms

**Windows** — WinSpool, datatype `"RAW"` so the spooler does not reinterpret:

```cpp
bool print_raw(const std::string& queue_name,
               const std::vector<uint8_t>& data,
               std::string& error_out) {
  HANDLE hPrinter = nullptr;
  if (!OpenPrinterA(const_cast<char*>(queue_name.c_str()), &hPrinter, nullptr)) {
    error_out = "OpenPrinter failed for '" + queue_name + "' (error " +
                std::to_string(GetLastError()) + ")";
    return false;
  }

  DOC_INFO_1A docInfo = {};
  docInfo.pDocName    = const_cast<char*>("Raw Print Job");
  docInfo.pOutputFile = nullptr;
  docInfo.pDatatype   = const_cast<char*>("RAW");

  bool  ok    = false;
  DWORD jobId = StartDocPrinterA(hPrinter, 1, reinterpret_cast<BYTE*>(&docInfo));
  if (jobId == 0) {
    error_out = "StartDocPrinter failed (error " + std::to_string(GetLastError()) + ")";
    ClosePrinter(hPrinter);
    return false;
  }

  if (!StartPagePrinter(hPrinter)) {
    error_out = "StartPagePrinter failed (error " + std::to_string(GetLastError()) + ")";
    EndDocPrinter(hPrinter);
    ClosePrinter(hPrinter);
    return false;
  }

  DWORD written = 0;
  BOOL  wroteOk = WritePrinter(hPrinter, const_cast<uint8_t*>(data.data()),
                               static_cast<DWORD>(data.size()), &written);
  if (!wroteOk || written != data.size()) {
    error_out = "WritePrinter failed or short write (error " +
                std::to_string(GetLastError()) + ")";
  } else {
    ok = true;
  }

  EndPagePrinter(hPrinter);
  EndDocPrinter(hPrinter);
  ClosePrinter(hPrinter);
  return ok;
}
```

**macOS / Linux** — CUPS, via a temp file, with `raw` so filtering is skipped:

```cpp
bool print_raw(const std::string& queue_name,
               const std::vector<uint8_t>& data,
               std::string& error_out) {
  std::string tmp_path;
  if (!write_temp_file(data, tmp_path, error_out)) return false;
  bool ok = print_raw_file(queue_name, tmp_path, error_out);
  std::remove(tmp_path.c_str());
  return ok;
}

bool print_raw_file(const std::string& queue_name,
                    const std::string& file_path,
                    std::string& error_out) {
  cups_option_t* options     = nullptr;
  int            num_options = 0;
  num_options = cupsAddOption("raw", "true", num_options, &options);
  num_options = cupsAddOption("document-format", "application/vnd.cups-raw",
                              num_options, &options);

  int job_id = cupsPrintFile2(CUPS_HTTP_DEFAULT, queue_name.c_str(),
                              file_path.c_str(), "Raw Print Job",
                              num_options, options);
  cupsFreeOptions(num_options, options);

  if (job_id == 0) {
    error_out = std::string("cupsPrintFile2 failed: ") + cupsLastErrorString();
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```

Same signature and same header, two entirely different bodies — neither API
exists on the other platform, which is why this cannot collapse into one
function.

## 4. Findings that shape the build

**Submitting must not block the guest.** `ByteStream` is emphatic: the board
never blocks, because blocking stops emulated time and that is how an emulator
drops characters. `cupsPrintFile2` talks to a daemon and `StartDocPrinter` talks
to the spooler; either can take a noticeable moment, and neither may be called
from `write()`. Submission happens on the `pump()`/flush path, and if it turns
out to be slow enough to be felt, it wants a worker — but measure before
building one.

*Measured (macOS 26, CUPS 2.3.4, `socket` backend to a local `nc`):* a submit is
**~1–3 seconds**, and the **first job is slower** — daemon and backend warm-up,
not anything in the buffer. That is slow enough to be felt. As built, the submit
runs on the run-loop thread (`pump()` → the idle timer → `cupsPrintFile2`), so a
job boundary that fires **mid-`RUN`** freezes the guest for that interval. At
`DISCONNECT`/exit it only delays the prompt, which is harmless, and for the usual
print-a-report-then-return flow the hitch lands while the guest is already idle —
so Phase 1 ships synchronous. But the measurement clears the note's own gate:
**deferring submission to a background worker thread is a warranted Phase-2
improvement.** It is safe to thread precisely because submission is host-side
dwell that no register exposes — it never touches emulated time, so a worker does
not endanger determinism the way a guest-visible thread would (§2.1). The failed
job would then reach `drainLog()` a slice later instead of inline, which is the
one wrinkle to handle.

**A failed job must be loud and must not be silent data loss.** A queue that has
gone away, a printer that is off — these produce an error string from both APIs,
and it has to reach the operator through `Board::drainLog()`, the same route a
serial port uses to say it cannot do 76800 baud. The precedent to avoid is the
blank-tape trap: an operation that reports success and produces nothing usable.

**`list_queues` earns a `SHOW`.** The `serial:` endpoint already names the ports
this host actually has when the open fails, because "cannot open the printer"
with no further help is ten minutes of someone doubting the simulator. A bad
queue name should print the queues that exist. It is the same courtesy and the
same three lines.

**The transforms are the console's, and a printer is not a console.** `upper`,
`strip7out` and `crlf` are console properties; a line to a printer is 8-bit
clean, because ESC/P and every other printer control language needs the high
bit. Whether a printer stream wants CR/LF translation of its own is a separate
question and should be answered separately, not by reaching for the console's
knobs.

**Testing it means not needing a printer.** No CI runner has one. The testable
half is the buffering and the boundary policy — feed bytes, advance host
seconds, assert one job of the right bytes came out — which works against a fake
submit sink and needs neither CUPS nor paper. Set the clock explicitly, the way
a display blink test sets `hostSeconds` rather than sleeping. The platform
submit path stays untested by machine, and that is honest and worth saying out
loud rather than papering over.
