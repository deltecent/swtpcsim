# The fonts the PDFs are printed in

These six files exist so that **the machine that builds the PDF stops mattering**.

`docs/print.css` used to name a wish list — `"Charter", "Georgia", "Palatino", serif` —
and a wish list resolves to whatever fonts the builder happens to own. That was invisible
while exactly one Mac ever built the documents. It became a real problem the moment CI
started building them: `ubuntu-latest` has none of those three, so it would have re-typeset
the manual in fallback DejaVu Serif — a different face, different pagination and a
different page count from every copy shipped so far — without a word of complaint.

So the document carries its own faces. `pandoc --embed-resources` inlines them as `data:`
URIs, and **`tools/build-docs.sh` fails the build if any one of them does not inline**.
That check is not ceremony: pandoc only *warns* about a font it cannot fetch and still
exits 0, so the cost of trusting it is a silently wrong PDF — which is the exact failure
this directory was created to end.

## What is here, and where it came from

Nothing here is subsetted. A subset would be a quarter of the size, but it would also be a
partial font — harder to check against its source, and one that fails a missing glyph by
printing a blank box rather than by saying so. So every glyph the upstream face has is here.

The DejaVu files are **unmodified upstream release files**, verifiable against upstream by
hash. The XCharter files are the one exception: they are TrueType **converted** from the
upstream `.otf` (which is what upstream ships), because the PDF renderer mangles copy-paste
out of a CFF font — the reason and the reproducible conversion are under **XCharter** below.
Both are pinned by hash on both ends, and both licenses below are satisfied simply by keeping
this notice next to them (each grant permits redistribution, and XCharter's permits
modification outright).

### XCharter — the body text

An extension of Bitstream Charter by Michael Sharpe. Charter is what the manual has always
been set in (macOS ships Bitstream Charter as `Charter.ttc`); XCharter is the same typeface
from a source we are allowed to redistribute, so switching to it changed the look of the
document by essentially nothing.

The files here are TrueType, and that is deliberate — it is the one exception to the
"unmodified upstream file" rule above, forced by the renderer. Chrome's `--print-to-pdf`
embeds a CFF OpenType `.otf` as a **Type 3** font, whose text layer carries no reliable word
spacing, so text copied out of the PDF comes back with spaces jammed into the middle of words
(`Using alt airsim, ...` — issue #246). A **TrueType** font embeds as CID TrueType and copies
clean, which is exactly why DejaVu below — already `.ttf` — was never affected while every
word of XCharter body text was. XCharter ships no `.ttf` upstream (CTAN has only
`opentype/` and `type1/`), so these four faces are **converted from the upstream `.otf`** by
`tools/otf2ttf.py`, a deterministic cu2qu conversion (cubic outlines → quadratic `glyf`, CFF
dropped, PostScript names kept). The conversion is reproducible: cu2qu is deterministic and
fontTools copies the source `head` timestamps, so the same fontTools on the same `.otf` yields
byte-identical output. Both ends are pinned below — verify the `.otf` against upstream, then
re-run the script and verify the `.ttf`.

### DejaVu Sans Mono — the code

Every listing and terminal transcript in the manual. **The mono matters more than the serif
here, not less**: the listings are written to a hard 79 columns and mono is the unit a code
block's width is measured in. DejaVu Sans Mono was already the Linux end of the old wish
list, and its advance width (0.602em) is Menlo's — so pinning it moved almost nothing and
guarantees all of it.

## Licenses

swtpcsim is MIT. **These fonts are not**, and neither of them needs to be: both licenses
below permit redistribution outright. Both also require that the notice travel with the
font, which is what this file is for. The full texts are in `LICENSE-XCharter.txt` and
`LICENSE-DejaVu.txt` beside them.

Note what is *not* here: macOS's `/System/Library/Fonts/Supplemental/Charter.ttc` and
`Menlo.ttc` — which is what the old wish list actually resolved to on the machine that
built every shipped PDF. Those are Apple's builds, covered by the macOS license, and
copying them into a public repository is not something the underlying Bitstream grant makes
alright. That is why XCharter and DejaVu are here instead of the fonts you already have.
