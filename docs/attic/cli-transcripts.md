# The paper CLI — annotated session transcripts

**Status:** Step 0. **Reviewed and signed off before implementation starts.** These become the acceptance script.

> The board API can be validated on paper by hand-tracing. A CLI cannot — it is judged by whether it is *pleasant to actually use*, and you only learn that by using it. Reading these transcripts is how you discover that a verb is wrong, a default is annoying, or output is unreadable, **at the cost of editing Markdown rather than refactoring a command dispatcher.**

Every command used here is drawn from `DESIGN.md` §10. Where a transcript **needed** something §10 does not define, that is recorded as a **finding** (F1…F12) rather than quietly invented. The findings are the deliverable; the transcripts are the vehicle.

**Grounding.** Transcripts 1 and 4 use the **real** DBL 4.1 boot PROM (`dbl.bin`, 256 bytes, disassembled by Martin Eberhard in `dbl.prn`); the hex and the disassembly below are the actual bytes, not plausible ones. Transcript 1's CP/M sign-on is the real string from `BIOS.ASM:363`. Transcript 3's program is hand-assembled and verified by hand below.

---

## Conventions these transcripts assume — and which §10 does not yet state

Writing the transcripts forced these into the open. Each is **F3** unless noted.

| Convention | Assumed here |
|---|---|
| Prompt | `swtpcsim> ` |
| Number base | **Addresses, ports, and data are hex** (`0x` prefix optional and accepted). **Counts, sizes, and rates are decimal** — `SET sio2a:a BAUD=9600` is 9600 bps, `STEP 20` is twenty steps. |
| Ranges | `100-1FF` (inclusive) or `100:20` (start + count). |
| Case | Commands and property names case-insensitive; file paths and endpoints case-preserving. |
| Script comments | `;` to end of line, in `-c` scripts. |

That table is a **finding, not a decision**: §10 defines none of it, and `BREAK 100` is ambiguous until it does.

```
$ swtpcsim machines/cpm.toml
```
> **F4.** §10 only ever mentions `swtpcsim -c script.cmd` and `swtpcsim --mcp`. **The command-line grammar is undefined** — there is no stated way to say "start with this machine." Proposed: `swtpcsim [config.toml] [-c script.cmd] [--mcp | --mcp-port N]`.

A0>
```

> **There is no `BOOT` command, and that is deliberate** (`DESIGN.md` §10.0). The 8080 starts at `0000`; the DBL PROM lives at `FF00`. SIMH bridges that by synthesizing a bootstrap internally — **fabricated hardware, forbidden by §0.1.** The real machine bridges it with a **power-on jump** on the turnkey board, which we may model later once the 88-TURNKEY manual is in hand (§17).
>
> Until then the honest answer is the one an operator gives: **`GO FF00`**. And the machine config carries that keystroke so you don't retype it every session:
> ```toml
> [machine]
> sense   = 0x00
> startup = [ "GO FF00" ]     # monitor commands, run once the backplane exists
> ```
> The payoff is bigger than convenience: **the config language and the script language are now one language.** Anything you can type, a config can do — which is most of what F9 below needs.

> **F6 — a real gap, and it blocks the milestone-3 boot.** The DBL PROM does this at `FF22`:
> ```
> FF22  DB FF     IN   0FFH      ; read the SENSE switches
> FF24  E6 10     ANI  10H       ; stop-bit select for the 2SIO
> ```
> It **literally reads port 0xFF at boot** to choose the 2SIO's stop-bit configuration. `DESIGN.md` §1 says "sense switches at port 0xFF are a config value" — but **`docs/config.md` had no key for them and §10 had no `SET` target for them.** Now fixed: a `[machine] sense` key, plus `SHOW MACHINE` (**F10**, which did not exist either):
> ```
> swtpcsim> SHOW MACHINE
>   name      cpm-dev
>   clock     2000000 Hz
>   sense     00        (port 0xFF — front-panel sense switches)
>   startup   GO FF00
> ```

> ### ⚠️ F6 WAS NOT FIXED, AND IT SAID IT WAS FOR MONTHS. (Patrick, 2026-07-12)
>
> Read the "fix" above again. It added a `[machine] sense` **key**, a `SHOW MACHINE` **line**, and
> a `CONFIG SAVE` **line** — and it wired the value **to nothing at all**. No board decoded port
> `0xFF`. So `IN 0FFH` fell through to the floating bus and returned `0xFF`, forever, whatever you
> configured, and **DBL's `ANI 10H` was testing a pulled-up wire instead of a switch**. The bit came
> back set every time and the machine ran 8N1 by luck.
>
> Every symptom a working feature has, this had. It parsed. It round-tripped. It printed. The one
> thing it did not do was the thing it was for, and *the transcript's own boot worked*, which is
> how it survived.
>
> **The failure was not the missing wire. It was believing `DESIGN.md` §1** — "sense switches at
> port 0xFF are a **config value**" — which is the sentence that made a config key look like a
> complete answer. It is not a config value. It is eight toggle switches on a card, and the card is
> the Display/Control board.
>
> **Actually fixed 2026-07-12:** the panel is a board (`fp`), it decodes `IN 0FFH`, and
> `Machine::sense` is **deleted** — the field, the key, the `SHOW` line and the `CONFIG SAVE` line.
> `[machine] sense` is now a load **error** that hands you the `[[board]]` block replacing it. See
> `docs/boards/mits-frontpanel.md`. A machine with no panel still honestly returns `0xFF` on the
> floating bus.
>
> The lesson is cheaper to write down than to relearn: **a config key is not a feature.** Nothing

> **F1 — there is no way to leave the program in §10.** This is not a nitpick: a disk image with a dirty write-back buffer needs a defined shutdown, and the porting notes (`§ BIOS track-buffer trap`) say the buffer may still be holding a directory update. Leaving must flush, and must *say* it flushed.

## Transcript 2 — build a machine, hit a port collision, fix it

**Milestone 1.** This is the transcript that tests whether contention-as-a-feature (§4.6) actually pays off in practice.

```
$ swtpcsim

Now the mistake — a second 2SIO, and the base address is wrong:

```

sio2b: 88-2sio added. io 12-15.

```

> **This is the moment the design is trying to buy**, and it lands: the collision is reported *at the instant it is created*, naming both boards and the exact overlapping ports — not discovered three hours later as "BASIC prints garbage on channel B." Note it also names the *channels*, not just the boards, which is what you actually need in order to fix it.

  fix: SET sio2b PORT=14   (or any base >= 14)
```

> The last line — the monitor *suggesting the fix* — is the difference between a diagnostic and a tool. It can do it because `properties()` tells it `port` is the board's base and the decode is 4 wide. It costs nothing and it is exactly the thing you want at 1 a.m.

```
swtpcsim> SET sio2b PORT=14
error: `port` is a config-time property and the machine is running.
       STOP the machine, or POWER it down, before changing it.

swtpcsim> STOP
already stopped (machine has never run).
```

> **Bug in my own transcript, and worth keeping.** The machine has never been started, yet `SET` rejected the change as "running." "Running" and "configured" are different states, and §5's `runtime` flag conflates them. **F11:** a board needs three states, not two — *unconfigured* (freely settable), *configured but halted* (settable, takes effect on next reset), *running* (config-time properties locked). `SHOW <id>` must display which. As written, you cannot build a machine interactively at all, which is the entire point of this transcript.

Assuming that is fixed:

```
swtpcsim> SET sio2b PORT=14

> `SHOW` is **fully generic** — it knows nothing about baud rates. Everything in that table came from `Board::properties()`, which is also what generated the `BOARD TYPES` listing, the tab completion, the TOML round-trip, and the MCP schema. That is §5 paying off, and the transcript confirms the shape is right.

## Transcript 3 — the debug loop

**Milestone 1.** Where the hours actually go, and therefore the most important transcript in this file.

The program: print `HELLO` on 2SIO channel A, polled. Hand-assembled, and **it has a bug**, which is the point.

```asm
        ORG  0100H
SIOCTL  EQU  10H              ; 6850 ch. A control (w) / status (r)

        MVI  A,03H            ; 6850 master reset
        OUT  SIOCTL
        MVI  A,11H            ; /16, 8 data bits, 2 stop, no interrupts

> **F5.** `NOBREAK` cleared everything, silently. §10 gives `BREAK` and `NOBREAK` and **no way to list breakpoints** — but MCP has a `breakpoints` tool (§11), so the capability exists and only the monitor lacks it. Proposed: bare `BREAK` lists; `NOBREAK <n>` clears one; `NOBREAK` clears all *and says how many*, as above.
>
> **F8.** §10.2 refers to `EXAMINE` as one of the through-the-bus commands, but §10's command list never defines it. Either add it (as an alias for a 1-byte `DUMP`) or strike it from §10.2 — right now the design contradicts itself.

Verifying the patch didn't just get lucky:

> **Note the address.** `AT 0000 RAW turnkey` — **board-local offset zero**, not `FF00`. That is the corrected §10.2: `RAW` addresses a board's own store, which is what makes it work uniformly for a banked RAM board whose store is bigger than the address space. An earlier draft wrote `LOAD dbl.bin AT 0xFF00 RAW turnkey`, mixing a bus address with a behind-the-bus command; that would have been a real trap.

> The `RAW` is *not optional* here: the ROM board correctly refuses a bus write, so loading its image **must** bypass the bus. Try it the obvious way and you get told so:

Now read it back *through the bus*, which is what the CPU will see:

> The `[turnkey, phantom]` annotation on every line is §10.2's promise kept: the bytes came from the ROM's phantom overlay, **not** from the RAM that also decodes `FF00-FFFF`. Without that tag, this dump is a lie by omission.

The payoff — proving the RAM underneath is still there, and still writable:

```
swtpcsim> DEPOSIT FF00 DE AD BE EF
FF00: 4 bytes written. (phantom=read: writes fell through to ram0.)

swtpcsim> DUMP FF00-FF0F

```

> **This is the whole point of the memory model, on one screen.** The write went *through* the phantom to the RAM; the read came *from* the phantom. The bus view and the board view disagree, and they are *supposed* to — and the CLI can show you both, so the disagreement is legible instead of maddening. If a user can produce those three dumps, PHANTOM is not going to confuse them again.

```
swtpcsim> WHO FF00
  address FF00 is registered by 2 boards:
    turnkey  rom  FF00-FFFF  enabled, asserts PHANTOM* on reads
    ram0     ram  0000-FFFF  enabled, honors PHANTOM*

  read  FF00:  turnkey pulls PHANTOM* (pin 67) -> ram0 disables itself -> turnkey answers.
  write FF00:  turnkey does not pull PHANTOM* on writes -> ram0 is live -> ram0 takes it.

  this is not contention. only one board drives either cycle.
```

> **This is the corrected §4.2, and the wording is the whole point.** The bus does not "pick a winner." The ROM *pulls a signal* and the RAM *turns itself off* — so "writes fall through" stops being a special rule and becomes the obvious consequence of a ROM that only asserts PHANTOM\* on reads. `SHOW BUS CONTENTION` stays quiet because, on any given cycle, exactly one board is really driving.
>
> Strap the RAM the other way and the simulator hands you the bug the backplane would have:

**The boot ROM that switches itself out** (§4.2.1) — the case that motivated all of this:

```
swtpcsim> SHOW BUS MAP
  range        board    type  state
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  0000-FFFF    ram0     ram   enabled, honors PHANTOM*
  FF00-FFFF    turnkey  rom   enabled, asserts PHANTOM* on reads

; ... the boot code runs, and as its last act writes to the ROM board's port,
; switching itself out so the RAM underneath becomes visible ...

swtpcsim> SHOW BUS MAP
  range        board    type  state
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  0000-FFFF    ram0     ram   enabled, honors PHANTOM*

  FF00  DE AD BE EF 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00   ................
```

> The ROM is gone and the RAM is showing through — and `SHOW BUS MAP` says **who disabled it and from what PC**, which is the difference between a five-minute diagnosis and an afternoon. A board that is present but decoding nothing is otherwise completely invisible.
>
> **And this is where `POWER` vs `RESET` earns its keep** (§6). `POWER` must re-enable the ROM or the machine boots exactly once and never again. Whether the front-panel `RESET` also re-enables it is a **board strap**, and it is the classic source of "boots from power-on, dead from the reset button" — because a warm reset that leaves the ROM switched out drops the CPU onto RAM at 0000, where it executes garbage.
> ```

## Transcript 5 — the same machine, driven from MCP

**Milestone 1.** The test here is whether MCP is genuinely a first-class interface (§11) or a wrapper around a text CLI.

Bring up transcript 3's machine and run 4K MITS BASIC on it — acceptance test 1.

```jsonc
// -> board_list()
{"boards": [
  {"id": "cpu0",  "type": "88-cpu",  "cpu": "8080", "clock": 2000000},
  {"id": "ram0",  "type": "ram",     "base": 0, "size": 65536},
  {"id": "sio2a", "type": "88-2sio", "port": 16, "interrupt": "int",
   "units": {"a": {"baud": 9600, "connect": "console"},
             "b": {"baud": 9600, "connect": null}}}
]}
```

> Note `"port": 16` — **JSON has no hex.** The monitor shows `10`, MCP says `16`, and they are the same port. That is fine, but it must be *stated*, or the first person to write an MCP test will file a bug. **F3** again, from the other side.

```jsonc
// -> board_set({"id": "sio2a", "unit": "a", "key": "baud", "value": 300})
{"ok": true, "id": "sio2a", "unit": "a", "baud": 300, "previous": 9600}

// -> mem_load({"file": "basic4k.bin", "at": 0})
{"ok": true, "bytes": 4096, "range": [0, 4095], "format": "binary"}

// -> run({"max_steps": 5000000, "idle_threshold": 1000})
{"reason": "idle", "steps": 182446, "t_states": 1093221,
 "output": "MEMORY SIZE? "}
```

> **`"reason": "idle"` is the single most valuable thing in this document.** BASIC is sitting in a polling loop on the 6850 status port; it will never halt and never hit a breakpoint. Without idle detection (§8) this call burns five million steps and returns `max_steps`, and every automated test is slow and ambiguous. With it, the call returns in milliseconds *and tells you the machine is parked at a prompt.* The porting notes are right that this is what makes automation work.

```jsonc
// -> send({"text": "\r"})
{"ok": true, "queued": 1}

// -> expect({"pattern": "OK", "max_steps": 5000000, "idle_threshold": 1000})
{"found": true, "steps": 44102, "t_states": 264612,
 "output": "MEMORY SIZE? \r\nTERMINAL WIDTH? \r\nWANT SIN? \r\n4K BASIC\r\nOK\r\n"}

// -> send({"text": "PRINT 2+2\r"})
{"ok": true, "queued": 10}

// -> expect({"pattern": "^ 4", "max_steps": 1000000, "idle_threshold": 1000})
{"found": true, "steps": 8817, "t_states": 52902, "output": " 4 \r\nOK\r\n"}
```

**Acceptance test 1, met.** And the failure path is what makes `expect` worth having:

```jsonc
// -> expect({"pattern": "SYNTAX ERROR", "max_steps": 1000000, "idle_threshold": 1000})
{"found": false, "reason": "idle", "steps": 1204, "t_states": 7224,
 "output_tail": " 4 \r\nOK\r\n"}
```

> It returns **`output_tail` on failure**. Anyone who has debugged a test harness that says only `expected "X", timed out` knows why that one field is non-negotiable.

The debug tools, structured rather than scraped:

```jsonc
// -> regs()
{"a": 0, "f": {"s":false,"z":true,"ac":false,"p":true,"cy":false},
 "bc": 0, "de": 0, "hl": 287, "sp": 8192, "pc": 276, "t_states": 1093221}

// -> disasm({"at": 272, "count": 3})
{"lines": [
  {"addr": 272, "bytes": "DB 10",    "text": "IN 10"},
  {"addr": 274, "bytes": "E6 02",    "text": "ANI 02"},
  {"addr": 276, "bytes": "CA 10 01", "text": "JZ 0110"}]}

// -> bus_io()
{"ports": [
  {"port": 16, "board": "sio2a", "unit": "a", "dir": "inout", "what": "6850 control/status"},
  {"port": 17, "board": "sio2a", "unit": "a", "dir": "inout", "what": "6850 data"},
  {"port": 18, "board": "sio2a", "unit": "b", "dir": "inout", "what": "6850 control/status"},
  {"port": 19, "board": "sio2a", "unit": "b", "dir": "inout", "what": "6850 data"}],
 "contention": []}
```

> `bus_io()` returns the **same facts** as `SHOW BUS IO`, from the same `Machine` API, without the ASCII table. That is the §11 claim — one engine, two front ends — and it holds up here. The monitor's version is not the source of truth that MCP parses; both render one model.

### But there is a hole, and it is in the CI story

**F9 — the acceptance tests cannot actually be run as specified.**

The Step 0 roadmap (since removed) said every milestone has *"a written acceptance test that runs headless in CI on all four platforms via `swtpcsim -c script.cmd`."* But acceptance test 1 is *"BASIC answers `PRINT 2+2`"* — and answering that requires `send` and `expect`, which **exist only in MCP** (§11). §10's command language has no way to type at the guest or wait for output. So:

- the CI gate as written is **unmeetable with `-c script.cmd`**, and
- the two interfaces are **not** at parity, which contradicts §11's central claim.

Two ways out, and the second is better:

1. Run CI through MCP with a JSON driver script. Works, but now the monitor is a second-class citizen and `-c script.cmd` is decorative.
2. **Give the monitor `SEND`, `EXPECT`, and `RUN` as real commands** (with an exit status), so a `.cmd` script is a genuine test script:
   ```
   ; acceptance/m1-basic.cmd — exits nonzero on failure
   CONFIG LOAD machines/basic.toml
   LOAD basic4k.bin AT 0000
   RUN IDLE=1000
   SEND "\r"
   EXPECT "OK" TIMEOUT=5000000
   SEND "PRINT 2+2\r"
   EXPECT " 4" TIMEOUT=1000000
   ECHO "acceptance test 1: PASS"
   EXIT 0
   ```
   This costs almost nothing — the engine is already there for MCP — and it makes §11's "one `Machine` API, two front ends" true rather than aspirational. **Recommended.**

## Findings — the punch list

The transcripts did their job: none of these were visible in `DESIGN.md`, and all of them would have been discovered by writing code instead.

| # | Finding | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| **F1** | **No `EXIT`/`QUIT` command exists in §10.** No defined shutdown — and a dirty disk write-back buffer needs one. | **blocking** |
| **F2** | No `HELP`. | should fix |
| **F3** | **Number base, range grammar, and case rules are undefined.** `BREAK 100` is ambiguous. JSON-vs-monitor hex/decimal must be stated. | **blocking** |
| **F4** | **Command-line invocation grammar undefined** — no stated way to start with a machine file. | **blocking** |
| **F5** | No way to **list** breakpoints in the monitor, though MCP has `breakpoints`. | should fix |
| **F6** | **Sense switches (port 0xFF) had no config key and no `SET` target** — but the DBL PROM reads them at `FF22` to configure the 2SIO. Would have blocked the milestone-3 boot. ~~**✅ Fixed:** `[machine] sense`, plus `SHOW MACHINE`.~~ **THAT FIX WAS A FICTION** — the key parsed into a byte that nothing put on the bus, so `IN 0FFH` read the floating bus (`0xFF`) regardless. **Actually fixed 2026-07-12:** the front panel is a *board* (`fp`) and it decodes the port. `[machine] sense` is deleted. See the ⚠️ note above. | ~~blocking~~ ~~fixed~~ **fixed for real** |
| **F7** | **`BOOT` had no honest semantics.** The SIMH answer (synthesize a bootstrap) is forbidden by §0.1; the real mechanism is a turnkey board's **power-on jump**, which needs a manual we don't have. **✅ Fixed by removing `BOOT` entirely** (§10.0): the config file carries `startup = ["GO FF00"]` — the operator's keystroke, written down, inventing nothing. | ~~blocking~~ **fixed** |
| **F8** | §10.2 references `EXAMINE`; §10 never defines it. The design contradicts itself. | should fix |
| **F9** | **The CI acceptance gate is unmeetable as specified.** `send`/`expect` exist only in MCP, so `swtpcsim -c script.cmd` cannot run acceptance test 1. Proposed: `SEND`/`EXPECT`/`RUN`/`ECHO`/`EXIT n` in the monitor. *Mostly unblocked by §10.0's `startup` list, which already makes config and script one language — this is the remaining half.* | **blocking** |
| **F10** | No `SHOW MACHINE` / `SHOW VERSION`. Nowhere to see the clock, the sense switches, or the startup commands. **✅ Fixed** alongside F6. | ~~should fix~~ **fixed** |
| **F11** | **§5's `runtime` flag conflates "configured" with "running."** A board needs three states, or you cannot build a machine interactively — which breaks transcript 2 entirely. | **blocking** |
| **F12** | An I/O port claimed by **zero** boards is silent. §4.6 covers two claimants but not none. Proposed `SET BUS UNCLAIMED=WARN` — it is what turns a `R.COM` hang into an explanation. | should fix |

### Resolved: how the CPU reaches `0xFF00` — and why there is no `BOOT`

**Asked and answered** (Patrick, 2026-07-11). The real mechanism is a **power-on jump**: a turnkey/PROM board forces the processor to the PROM address after reset. Simulators typically don't model it — they come up at a prompt and the operator types `G FF00`.

Two consequences, both now in the design:

1. **`BOOT` is deleted** (§10.0). It could only ever have been dishonest: SIMH's version synthesizes a bootstrap the hardware never had, which §0.1 forbids outright. `GO FF00` is what the operator actually does, so that is what the monitor offers.
2. **Machine configs carry a `startup` command list** — Patrick's suggestion, and it is strictly better than `BOOT`. `startup = ["GO FF00"]` automates the keystroke while inventing nothing, and it makes **the config language and the script language the same language**, which is most of what F9 needs. `SHOW MACHINE` prints it; `CONFIG SAVE` round-trips it.

**Still deferred, and it needs a manual (§17): modeling power-on jump as a real board property.** That is the honest long-run model for a project that calls itself a hardware bench, and it costs nothing to support *if* the `Board` interface lets a board claim an `OpFetch` cycle the way the 88-VI claims an `IntAck` (§4.4) — which would be one more piece of evidence that the bus model is right. **The 88-TURNKEY manual would settle it.** Nothing in milestones 1–3 is blocked on it.
