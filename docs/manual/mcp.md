# The MCP server

```
$ swtpcsim --mcp
```

That runs `swtpcsim` as an **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** on stdin and stdout, so
that an AI assistant — Claude, or anything else that speaks MCP — can drive the machine
through **typed, structured tools** instead of screen-scraping a text terminal.

It is not a wrapper, and it is not a second model of the world. **The MCP server runs on the
same machine object as the monitor.** What the tools see is exactly what `SHOW` sees, because
it is the same machine, answering the same questions, through a different door.

## What the tools do

Enough to operate the machine:

- List the board types available, and every property each one has — **with its type, its
  default and its legal range.**
- List the boards actually in the machine.
- Get and set any property on any board.
- Add a board; mount a disk or a tape into it; wire a serial line to an endpoint.
- Examine, deposit, fill, search, save and disassemble memory.
- Run the machine, step it, set breakpoints, and read the bus flight recorder.
- Snapshot the whole machine's state and restore it.

The five you will see named are `board_types`, `board_list`, `board_get`, `board_set` and
`board_add`. The rest follow the monitor's own vocabulary.

## Driving a running guest

Building a machine is half of it; the other half is **operating one that is running** —
typing at its console and reading what it prints. Four tools do that, and they are what
let an assistant boot FLEX, run a program, and talk to it over a serial port entirely
through MCP:

- **`run`** — advance the guest a bounded slice and return what it printed. It is the
  expect loop in one call: pass `input` to type a line, `until` to stop when a string
  (a prompt like `+++`) appears, `from` to set the PC first (booting is `from` the ROM
  monitor's reset entry). It **also stops on its own when the guest reaches a prompt** — spinning on the
  console with nothing to say — so you get control back without guessing a timeout. Every
  stop says why in `stopped`: `match`, `idle`, `timeout`, `steps`, `halt`, `breakpoint`,
  `unclaimed` (under `SET BUS UNCLAIMED=HALT`), `tape-stop` (a `BREAK TAPE STOP`), or
  `interrupted` (see below). A `SET BUS UNCLAIMED=WARN` line, or any other bus or board
  message from the run, comes back in `warnings`. JSON has no hex, so `from` is a decimal
  number (`65496` for `FFD8`); a string such as `"0xFFD8"` is refused with the number to send.
- **`send`** — type at the console without running (then `run` to let it be read).
- **`recv`** — drain what the guest has printed since you last looked, without running.
- **`regs`** — the CPU registers right now.
- **`status`** — a guaranteed-non-blocking check: whether the server is currently busy on
  ANY call (not just `run`), plus the CPU board id and the last `run`'s step count/PC. It
  never queues behind anything, including a `run` that never ends — see "Stopping a `run`
  that will not end" below for why that matters and what its fields mean when nothing is
  running.

The shape of a session is therefore: `run {from: 0xE0D0, until: "$"}` to reach the SWTBUG
monitor and `run {input: "D", until: "+++"}` to boot FLEX, then `run {input: "CAT\r", until:
"+++"}` per command, reading the reply each time. A `run`
**never blocks** — it advances the guest for at most `timeout_ms` (default 2000) and
returns — so a `tools/call` always comes back, unlike a bare `RUN` through the `monitor`
tool, which under a pipe waits on a stdin that is the JSON-RPC channel itself.

What you type goes to the guest byte for byte, control characters included, and every line in
the machine is 8-bit clean. A control byte is written as a JSON `\uXXXX` escape: `\u0003` is
^C, `\u001b` is ESC. So `send {text: "\u001b"}` pauses a FLEX listing exactly as the ESC key
would. Note that `\x03` is **not** JSON — JSON has no `\x` escape — and it arrives at the
guest as the three ordinary characters `x03` rather than as a control byte.

By default the guest runs flat out, which is what you want for booting and for driving a
prompt. But when a real device is on a serial line and you have set a clock speed with `SET
cpu0 clock_hz=…`, `run` paces the guest to that clock, so a reply the device sends a fraction
of a second later lands while the guest is still waiting for it.

`timeout_ms` is a hard wall-clock ceiling, full stop — traffic on a live wire does not extend
it. A boot loader that reads its whole system image in over a serial disk is not cut off
mid-block; it is bounded the same way any other call is: give it a `timeout_ms` as long as the
worst case takes (up to 600000 ms), and let it return early on `until` or a prompt the moment it
finishes, exactly as a fast call does. A call that hits `timeout_ms` mid-transfer returns
`stopped: "timeout"` with whatever it has read so far — a normal result to loop `run` on, not a
failure, and `regs`/`mem_dump` can confirm a destination pointer is still climbing while you do.

### Stopping a `run` that will not end

A `run` ends by itself at `timeout_ms`, but you may not want to wait that long. There are
two ways to stop it early, and both make the `run` in progress stop at once and return
`stopped: "interrupted"` with what the guest printed so far:

- **Cancel the request.** Send the standard MCP `notifications/cancelled` message naming the
  request id of the `run`. The server keeps reading its input while a `run` is going, so the
  cancel is seen straight away. A cancel that names some other request, or one that arrives
  after the `run` has returned, is ignored, and it never carries over to the next call. Other
  requests sent during a `run` are queued and answered in order once it returns — except
  `status`, which is the one call that is never queued: poll it to check whether a `run` you
  are considering cancelling is actually still alive, or already back to idle.
- **Send the process a ^C.** Press it in the terminal that started the server, or run
  `kill -INT` on its process ID.

The machine is left exactly as it was, so you can look at it and carry on with another `run`.
A ^C that arrives while no `run` is in progress does nothing to the guest, and a new `run`
always starts clean.

This changes what ^C does to an `--mcp` server you started by hand: the first ^C is caught,
not fatal. If you press ^C again before the server has reported the first one, the second
one ends the server as ^C normally would. A server started in the background, or with
`nohup`, ignores ^C altogether, as any such program does.

`status`'s `pc`/`steps` are only ever as fresh as the last `run` — a `step` or a `monitor`
command moves the real PC without updating them, and `steps` resets to zero on the next
`run`, so it is not monotonic across runs. `generation` is: it climbs on every publish, so
it is the field to watch for "still advancing" versus "stuck on the same slice."

Under `--mcp` the console line is quietly re-seated onto an in-memory terminal the server
owns (there is no host keyboard behind a pipe), which is what `send`/`run`/`recv` read and
write. Everything else on the machine — a second serial board wired to a real port, a
socket — keeps running and is serviced on every `run` slice, so a program shuttling bytes
between the console and a modem port works exactly as it would at a real terminal.

## Watching over your shoulder — `--mirror`

Add `--mirror socket:PORT` alongside `--mcp` and a person can `telnet localhost PORT` to
**watch the very session the assistant is driving** — every character the guest prints —
and **type back onto the line to take over**, sharing the console:

```
$ swtpcsim swtpc --mcp --mirror socket:2323
```

It wraps the assistant's console in the same mirror the monitor offers (`<endpoint>|socket:
PORT`, see the *Serial lines* chapter). The assistant keeps driving through `run`/`send`/
`recv` exactly as before — the mirror is transparent to it — while whatever it types and
whatever the guest prints also crosses the socket to the watcher. Add `?ro` to make it
watch-only — **quote it on the command line**, because `?` is a shell wildcard:

```
$ swtpcsim swtpc --mcp --mirror 'socket:2323?ro'
```

Without the quotes the shell tries to match `socket:2323?ro` as a filename and fails
(zsh reports `no matches found`) before `swtpcsim` ever sees it. One watcher at a time.

The watcher never sets the pace, and one thing follows from that: the guest only advances
**during a `run`**, so a character the watcher types between runs waits on the line and is
read on the next `run` — the same as `send` staging input for the next `run`. While a `run`
is in flight the two share the console live.

## Debugging and inspecting

The monitor's debugger is here too, structured. `step` advances a set number of instructions
and hands back the register file and where the CPU came to rest; `breakpoints` lists, adds and
removes the same breakpoints `BREAK` sets — and because they are the machine's breakpoints, a
`run` or a `step` stops when one fires. `disasm` decodes memory through a non-invasive read, so
it works on a ROM and even with no processor running. `bus_trace` returns the always-on flight
recorder — the last cycles every board saw, with who drove and who answered — and `bus_irq`
reports the interrupt lines the way `bus_map` reports the decode. `snapshot` and `restore` save
the whole machine's state and read it back into a machine built the same way.

None of these block, and none of them need the console: they are questions about the machine,
answered the same way `SHOW` answers them. When a typed tool does not reach a corner you need —
a conditional breakpoint, an octal listing — the `monitor` tool runs any monitor command and
returns its text.

## The schemas describe themselves

**Every tool's schema comes off the same reflection layer as the TOML keys and the
`SET`/`SHOW` commands.** There is one description of what a board is and what it can be
asked, and the machine file parser, the monitor, and the MCP server all read it.

The consequence is the point: **a board added tomorrow is drivable by an assistant the day
it lands, with no new code.** Nobody writes an MCP tool for the new board. The board declares
its properties, as it must anyway to be configurable at all, and the tool schema is that
declaration.

So there is no tool reference in this manual. Start the server and ask it what it has —
`tools/list` returns every tool the server exposes, and `board_types` every board type;
their answers are authoritative in a way a printed list could never be.

## Configuring an assistant to use it

MCP clients differ, but they all want the same two things: a command to run, and the fact
that it speaks over stdio. The command is `swtpcsim <machine> --mcp`, and it does. Register it
**once** and from then on you talk to the assistant, not to the server.

**Claude Code (the command line)** takes it as one command — everything after `--` is what it
will run, and it is best run from the directory you want the machine's files to resolve against:

```
claude mcp add swtpcsim -- swtpcsim <machine> --mcp
claude mcp list                       # confirm it registered and is reachable
```

**Claude Desktop, or any client that reads a JSON config**, wants an `mcpServers` entry naming
the command and its arguments (a `cwd` sets the working directory, since a desktop app has no
shell to inherit one from):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "swtpcsim": { "command": "swtpcsim", "args": ["<machine>", "--mcp"] }
  }
}
```

The `<machine>` is a built-in name or a machine file, exactly as on the command line. If
`swtpcsim` is not on your `PATH`, give its full path as the command.

You are not limited to one. Register several machines under different names (`swtpc-flex`,
`altair680`) and an assistant sees them all at once; `claude mcp add`'s *scope* decides whether
a server is tied to the one project directory you added it from (the default), travels with a
folder as a `.mcp.json` (`--scope project`), or is available everywhere (`--scope user`). One thing
to know for file exchange: the sandbox is the server's working directory. The `claude`
command line sets that to wherever you started it, so a relative machine path and the sandbox line
up with the folder you are in; the desktop app currently starts the server in your home directory
instead, so there give the machine an absolute path.

`DRIVING-WITH-AI.md`, in this package, is the briefing written for the assistant itself — drop it
in a working directory and the assistant has the recipes for booting, building and debugging over
these tools. An example folder such as `examples/flex/` is a ready-made such directory — a machine
and its disk together — for an assistant to drive over MCP.

## Starting a project of your own

An example folder such as `examples/flex/` is a ready-made round trip; once you want to write your
own software the same shape is how to begin. **Make a folder of your own, put a machine in it, and
point the assistant at that folder — not at the copy that came in the package.**

**Put the machine and its images at the root of the folder.** Copy a machine that boots the system
you want to build on — an `examples/flex/` folder is a good starting point, disk and
machine file together — into a new folder, and work there. Register the server from inside that
folder (as in the section above), so the machine file and the sandbox both resolve
there. The guest writes to the disk image as it runs and the assistant leaves build files beside
it, so keeping the shipped copy untouched means you always have a clean one to start over from.
Make that a real baseline: keep a spare copy of just the machine and its fresh disk, so "start
over" restores something known rather than whatever the guest last wrote.

**Give it the local truth to read.** Drop `DRIVING-WITH-AI.md` in the folder, and keep a second
folder — call it `Reference` — for anything else you want the assistant to lean on: the parts of
this manual that matter to your project, and any source material of your own, converted to plain
Markdown, which is the form an assistant ingests most reliably. These copies go stale the moment
swtpcsim updates, and the assistant cannot tell an old copy from a current one, so refresh them
when you update swtpcsim.

**Keep a hand on it — it will reach for what it already knows.** An assistant does not read your
machine's files and then do as they say. It predicts its next move from everything in front of it,
weighed against everything it learned in training — and what it learned is vast, while a line in a
local file is a single faint signal it saw a moment ago. So when the job looks like a common one —
boot FLEX, assemble a file, copy something onto a disk — the move it reaches for first is the one
it has seen a thousand times, even when the files in the folder say otherwise. A plain example:
asked to get a program onto a disk, it will reach for a host tool that does not
understand the DC-4's FLEX disks at all — when the way that works is to build inside the
machine itself, exactly as `DRIVING-WITH-AI.md` lays out. The pull toward the
familiar answer gets stronger the longer a session runs, and once it starts down that road it tends
to talk itself further along rather than stop and re-read.

So watch what it actually sends and reads back — the `--mirror` socket above is there for exactly
this — rather than trusting its own summary of what it did. Correct it at the first wrong step,
before it builds on that step, and point it at the file you mean and tell it to use that and only
that. Be most wary when its answer looks the most standard: that is the moment a habit has most
likely overridden something particular about your machine.

**Make starting and stopping a ritual.** A short instruction you give every session pays for
itself. At the end — "clean up" — have it close any processes still running, write down what you
learned, and save where you are in a note in the folder. At the start, have it read that note and
the `Reference` folder, boot the machine, and tell you where you left off. The note in the folder is
what makes a session resumable; without it the assistant reconstructs the state from scratch each
time, and reconstructs it wrong.
