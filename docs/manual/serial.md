# Serial ports, sockets and telnet

A 1970s microcomputer had no screen of its own. What it had was a serial board, and whatever
you chose to hang off it — a Teletype, a glass terminal, a modem, a paper tape reader. The
board did not know or care. It moved characters.

`swtpcsim` keeps that arrangement exactly. **Any board that moves characters has one or
more UNITS, and every unit can be CONNECTed to an ENDPOINT.** The unit is the socket on the
back of the board. The endpoint is what you plugged into it.

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:serial socket:2323
swtpcsim> DISCONNECT uio0:serial
```

That is the whole of the interface. The interesting part is the endpoint grammar, and it is
short enough to print in full.

## The endpoints

This table is exhaustive. There are no others.

| Endpoint | Is |
|---|---|
| `console` | the host terminal — your keyboard and your screen. |
| `null` | nowhere. Writes vanish. Reads never come. |
| `loopback` | itself. What the guest writes comes straight back as a read. |
| `socket:PORT` | **LISTENS** on that TCP port, as a raw pipe. |
| `socket:HOST:PORT` | **CALLS OUT** to that host and that port, as a raw pipe. |
| `telnet:PORT` | **LISTENS** like `socket:PORT`, but speaks the **Telnet protocol** — so a `telnet` client behaves: no double echo, one key at a time. This is the telnet-in case for a **person**. |
| `telnet:HOST:PORT` | **CALLS OUT** like `socket:HOST:PORT`, taking the telnet client's part. |
| `serial:DEVICE` | a real serial port on this host. |
| `in:PATH` | a host file, read-only — a **paper-tape reader**. The file's bytes feed the board. |
| `out:PATH` | a host file — a **paper-tape punch**. Whatever the board sends is written to it. |
| `in:PATH,out:PATH` | both at once on one line: a reader and a punch, two files, two positions. |
| `terminal` | a terminal in a window the simulator draws itself — a built-in VT100 (or ADM-3A, VT52, H19). Present only in a build with a display. See *A terminal in its own window*, below. |
| `printer:QUEUE` | a real print queue on this host, write-only. Buffers the bytes into a job and prints it. Present only where the build found a host print system. |
| `scripted` | a terminal with a caller in place of a human. No tty need exist. It is what the MCP tools and the test suite type into; you are unlikely to type it yourself. |

Any of these can be **tapped**: append `|FILE` to log the line to a hex file as it runs, or
`|socket:PORT` to **mirror** it live — a second person `telnet`s in to watch the session and can
type back onto the line to take over. Both are modifiers on an endpoint, not endpoints of their
own — see *Tapping a line to a log file* and *Mirroring a line so a person can watch and take
over*, below.

### `null` is not an error

An unconnected unit is `null`, and **that is a legitimate state, not a fault.** A 6850 with
no cable in it sits there with its transmit register permanently empty, forever ready, and a
program that writes to it runs perfectly and talks to nobody. Reads never complete because
nothing is sending.

Which is precisely what the real card does with no cable in it. A machine with a second
serial port nobody plugged anything into is not a broken machine. `null` models the missing
cable, and the guest is entitled to be fooled by it exactly as it would have been in 1977.

### The colon is the whole distinction

`socket:2323` **listens.** `socket:localhost:2323` **calls out.** One colon, and it is the
same convention every terminal program has used for forty years: a bare port is a port you
own, a host and a port is a place you go. Nothing else about the endpoint changes.

## Telnetting into the guest

Wire a unit to a listening socket, and the guest has a serial port with a terminal on the
end of it. That the terminal is your telnet client, several processes away, is not something
the guest can discover.

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:serial socket:2323
swtpcsim> RUN
```

Then, from another terminal on your machine:

```
$ telnet localhost 2323
```

The guest is now talking to that window. Your first terminal still has the monitor and
`^E` in it. This is how you give a machine two terminals, and it is how you drive a program
that wants a console that is not the one you are sitting at.

### `telnet:` when a person is at the other end

A `socket:` is a raw pipe: it moves bytes and negotiates nothing. That is right when the far
end is another program, but when a **person** points `telnet` (or `nc`) at it, their terminal
is left in its own default — it echoes every key locally *and* the guest echoes it back, so
each character appears twice, and Enter arrives as a whole line with its carriage return
turned into a line feed. The fix is not on your keyboard; it is to let the two ends negotiate,
which is what the Telnet protocol is for.

`telnet:` does that. It is `socket:` in every way but one — it speaks Telnet, offering to echo
and to send a character at a time, so a stock client drops its own echo and stops buffering
lines the moment it connects:

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:serial telnet:2323
swtpcsim> RUN
```

```
$ telnet localhost 2323
```

Now the session reads cleanly: one echo, from the guest, and each key reaches it as you press
it. Reach for `telnet:` whenever a human telnets into a BBS or a monitor, and keep `socket:`
for wiring one machine to another or for a line you mirror.

## A terminal in its own window

The telnet route above works, but it has moving parts you do not own: a telnet client must be
installed, it must be pointed at the right port, and it mangles any byte it thinks is a telnet
command — which breaks cursor sequences and file transfers, because to a serial line every
byte is just data. And a modern host terminal emulates a modern terminal, not the ADM-3A or
VT52 the 1970s software on the disk was written for.

`terminal` removes all of that. It is a terminal the simulator draws itself, in its own
window:

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT mps0:tty terminal
swtpcsim> RUN
```

The guest's console is now that window; the monitor and `^E` stay in the one you launched
from. There is nothing to install and nothing to connect — the window is up the moment the
line is, on every platform. Because the terminal is the simulator's, the emulation is exactly
the one you ask for, and it answers the reports (like `ESC[6n`) a period program expects.

Bare `terminal` is a VT100 in an 80×24 window. Options ride the connect string after a `?`,
joined by `&`, the same as any other endpoint:

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT mps0:tty terminal?emulation=adm3a
swtpcsim> CONNECT mps0:tty terminal?emulation=vt52&size=80x24
swtpcsim> CONNECT mps0:tty "terminal?emulation=h19&size=132x24"
```

`emulation` is one of `vt100` (the default; `ansi` is the same engine), `adm3a` (the Lear
Siegler ADM-3A, the classic 1970s serial terminal), `vt52`, or `h19` (the Heath/Zenith H19, a VT52
superset with an ANSI mode). `size` is *columns*×*rows* and defaults to `80x24`. `phosphor` is
the tube colour — `green` (the default) or `amber`. `width` is the opening window width in
pixels (a bare number, e.g. `width=1100`); left off, the window auto-sizes to about half the
screen. The text is drawn in the real **DEC VT220** character set, and pairs with the period
tube look — `[display] crt = true` (see [Configuring](configuring.md)), under which a `width`
opens the window at exactly that size.

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT mps0:tty terminal?emulation=vt100&phosphor=amber&width=1100
```

A `terminal` needs a window, so it is available only in a build with a display. Ask for one in
a build without, and it is refused cleanly at `CONNECT`, with the reason named; use `console`
or a `socket:` there instead.

The built-in terminal has the same fold-the-bytes settings the console does — `strip7out`,
`upper`, a CR/LF option and the rest — under `[terminal]`. They matter for a period monitor
that sets bit 7; see *The built-in terminal has these too*, later in this chapter.

## Calling out

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:serial socket:bbs.example.com:23
```

The guest dials. As far as the software inside the machine is concerned it has a modem and
the modem is connected; it will happily run a period terminal program over it.

## A real serial port

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:serial serial:/dev/tty.usbserial-A600K1XY
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:serial serial:COM3
```

The second form is Windows. The bytes go out of a real UART, down a real wire, into whatever
you have on the other end.

**If you get the device name wrong, it lists the ports that actually exist on your machine.**
It does not merely say "cannot open". A cable that appeared under a name one character off
from the one you expected is ten minutes of somebody quietly deciding the simulator is
broken, and the fix is to print the answer instead of the complaint.

### What the board does to the wire

The host port is opened at 9600 8N1, and then **immediately re-programmed by the board** —
because the board is the only thing in the system that knows what frame it is carrying. On the
6850-based serial boards here — the MP-S, the 680b onboard console, the 680b Universal I/O — the
word format is a **register the guest writes**, not a property, and there **must not** be a
property for it: a property would be a second place to say one thing, and the two would disagree
the moment software touched the chip. So the frame on the wire is whatever the **guest** last
programmed, and a guest that selects 7E1 reconfigures the cable to 7E1. Modem control lines —
DCD, CTS, RTS — are wired through.

### And give the machine its real crystal before you transfer a file

```
swtpcsim> SET cpu0 clock_hz=2000000
```

The moment the wire leaves the machine, the guest is talking to something that keeps time the
way *you* do — and it does not: it counts instructions, so flat out it retires a "three-second"
timeout in milliseconds and decides your sender is dead. Flat out is right for a machine talking
to itself; **a machine talking to you wants the crystal.** The troubleshooting chapter has the
full story.

## A paper-tape reader and punch: `in:` and `out:`

A serial or parallel line is where a **paper-tape station** lived, and `swtpcsim` gives you one
out of two host files. The direction is the keyword, not a flag:

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:p1a out:printout.txt          # a punch: capture what the board sends
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:p1a in:reader.tap             # a reader: feed a file to the board
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:p1a in:reader.tap,out:punch.tap   # both, on one bidirectional line
```

`in:` is a **reader** — a byte *source*. It reads the file from the start, hands the bytes to the
board one at a time, and when the file runs out the line simply goes **quiet**: no error, no
end-of-file byte, exactly as a reader with no more tape sits idle. A file that is not there is a
clean refusal at `CONNECT`, with the path named.

`out:` is a **punch** — a byte *sink*. Whatever the board sends is written to the file. It does
**not** truncate: it overwrites forward from the start and extends past the old end, so a short run
into a longer old file leaves the old tail behind — the same as spooling fresh tape over a reel
that still had some on it. An absent file is created.

`in:` and `out:` are **separate files with separate positions**, so the combined form is two
independent heads on one line — reading the tape cannot disturb what the punch has written, and
vice versa. Both are **8-bit clean**: the bytes on the wire are the bytes in the file, control
codes and all. Nothing reformats them. A relative path follows the usual rule: it resolves
against the machine's directory, whether it is written in a machine configuration or you type it.

### A reader with a speed

A real paper-tape reader has a rate, and a program that times its input cares. Pace an `in:` reader
with `?cps=N` (characters per second) or `?baud=N` (a line rate at 10 bits per character):

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:p1a in:tape.tap?cps=300       # a high-speed reader
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:p1a in:tape.tap?cps=30        # a slow reader
```

Give exactly one of `cps` or `baud`, and a positive rate. With neither, the reader runs flat out
— the generic default. The punch takes no options; it writes at the line's own speed.

## Printing to a real printer

Where your build was made with host printing, a line can go to a real print queue instead of a
host file:

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:p1a printer:linewriter
```

Host printing is built on **macOS and Linux** today; the **Windows** builds do not have it yet, so
on Windows `printer:` is absent and printing goes to a host file (`out:`) or a socket (`socket:`)
instead. To see which your build has, connect to `printer:` with no name — it either lists the
queues it can reach or tells you host printing is not in this build.

`printer:` is a **write-only** sink like `out:`, and just as un-printer-specific — any line can
use it. The difference is what happens to the bytes: they are held in a buffer and then handed to
the host print system as one **job**.

**When does a job end?** A printer has no "done" signal — a program prints and then simply stops.
So `swtpcsim` decides the boundary for you, and you can tune it in the endpoint itself:

| Option | Means | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `?idle=N` | end the job after **N seconds** with nothing more printed. `0` = never. | `5` |
| `?onff` | also end the job on a **form feed** (the page-eject character). | off |
| `?max=N` | end the job at **N bytes**, so a runaway program cannot fill memory. | a large number |

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:p1a printer:linewriter?idle=15
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:p1a printer:linewriter?onff
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:p1a "printer:Generic / Text Only?idle=0&onff"
```

Write a bare option (`?onff`) to turn it on; the common case never types `=1`. The boundaries
combine — the first to fire ends the job — and an **empty buffer never prints**, so a form feed
followed by silence does not leave a blank page behind. A job also goes out when you `DISCONNECT`
the line, load another machine, or quit, so nothing you printed is ever left un-sent.

The queue must be one the host passes through **untouched** (a *raw* queue): a printer control
language is not text, and a normal queue would try to reformat it. Creating that queue is a
one-time step in your operating system's printer setup, outside `swtpcsim`. If a queue name
contains spaces, quote the whole endpoint as shown above. Connect to `printer:` with no name and
`swtpcsim` lists the queues it can see.

Like `out:`, a printer line is **8-bit clean** — the bytes the program sent are the bytes the
printer gets.

## Tapping a line to a log file (a poor man's protocol analyzer)

When you are trying to work out what a guest and the far end are actually saying to each other,
you want to *see the bytes*. Append **`|FILE`** to any endpoint and `swtpcsim` writes every
byte that crosses the line — both directions — to a text file as it runs, in hex and ASCII, with
timestamps. The guest cannot tell the tap is there, and it never changes a byte, so it is safe on
a binary transfer as well as on a terminal.

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:serial socket:2323|bbs.hex
```

Telnet in, drive the guest, and `bbs.hex` fills with the conversation:

```
# swtpcsim capture  socket:2323  2026-07-29 14:03:11  fmt=dump
+0.001000  TX 0000  41 54 5A 0D                                       ATZ.
+0.048213  RX 0000  0D 0A 4F 4B 0D 0A                                 ..OK..
+9.100000  [DCD^]
+45.30000  [DTR_]
```

`TX` is what the guest sent, `RX` what came back; the offset counts bytes within a burst, and the
right-hand column is the ASCII (a `.` for anything unprintable). Lines in `[...]` are **modem
control-line** edges — carrier, DTR, RTS and the rest — logged as they change, with `^` for a
rising edge and `_` for a falling one, so you can see the far end pick up and hang up.

The file is truncated each time you connect: a capture is a fresh trace, not an append. The whole
tap is remembered — `SHOW` prints it and `CONFIG SAVE` writes it back — so a machine file can carry
a line that is permanently traced.

### Three layouts, and a few knobs

The tap's options ride the same `?key=value` grammar the other endpoints use, after the file name:

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:serial socket:2323|bbs.hex?fmt=cols
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:serial in:reader.tap?cps=300|trace.log?fmt=jsonl
```

- **`fmt=dump`** (the default) is the layout above: one hex row per line, strictly in time order —
  the easy one to read, and the easy one to `grep`.
- **`fmt=cols`** puts what the guest sent on the **left** and what it received on the **right**, so a
  request and its reply read down the page like a transcript.
- **`fmt=jsonl`** writes one JSON record per transfer — for feeding another program, diffing two
  runs, or importing into a spreadsheet.

The rest, all optional: `ts=elapsed` (the default — seconds since the first byte), `ts=wall` (the
host clock), or `ts=none`; `width=N` bytes per hex row (default 16); `gap=MS` for how long a quiet
line waits before a partial row is flushed (default 200 ms); and `pins=off` to leave the modem
control-line edges out. Note that the second example taps a **paced paper-tape reader** — the tap
composes with any endpoint, options and all.

## Mirroring a line so a person can watch and take over

A tap writes to a file. A **mirror** writes to a *socket*, and it is a two-way wire: append
`|socket:PORT` to any endpoint and a second person can `telnet localhost PORT` to watch the very
session the machine is having — every character the guest prints — and **type back onto the line**,
sharing it.

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT mps0:tty console|socket:2323
```

Now the guest talks to your terminal as before, and anyone who telnets to port 2323 sees the same
output and can join in at the keyboard. It is the same idea as the tap — a modifier that composes
with any endpoint — but where the tap only listens, the mirror also speaks. The everyday use is a
console being driven by a program: a person telnets in, watches it work, and takes the keyboard
when they want to.

There is no echo added by the mirror. What the watcher sees is exactly what the guest sends, and
what the watcher types is input the guest reads — so if the guest echoes (a monitor, FLEX), the
typed characters come back the ordinary way, and a password the guest does *not* echo stays unseen
at the mirror too. One watcher at a time, the same as a serial line is one wire.

Add `?ro` to make it **watch-only** — a spectator who cannot touch the keyboard:

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT mps0:tty console|socket:2323?ro
```

The watcher never sets the pace. If a watcher's connection is slow, or they pause their terminal,
the guest runs on regardless — a laggy watcher loses a little scrollback, never a byte of the
guest's. Like the tap, the mirror is remembered: `SHOW` prints it and `CONFIG SAVE` writes it back.

## A `CONNECT` it does not understand is an error

If `swtpcsim` cannot make sense of your endpoint, it **refuses, and tells you what it could
have meant.** It never quietly falls back to `null`.

This matters more than it sounds like it does. A silent fallback gives you a machine that
boots, runs, prints nothing, and hands you a dead terminal to debug — and you will debug the
guest, and the board, and the disk, before you think to doubt the thing you typed. A refusal
is a worse morning for exactly two seconds. A dead terminal is a worse afternoon.

## Exactly one unit may hold the console

The console is **your keyboard**, and there is one of it.

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT uio0:serial console
console taken from mps0:tty
uio0:serial: connected to console
```

Connecting a second unit to `console` **steals it, and says who it took it from.** It is not
an error and it is not shared. Two boards reading one keyboard would each get roughly half
the characters, in an order neither of them could predict, and the resulting machine would
appear to be haunted.

To see who has it:

```
swtpcsim> SHOW CONSOLE
```

That also shows the transforms, which is the rest of this chapter.

## The transform chain belongs to the console

This is the most important rule in the chapter, and it is worth stating twice before
explaining it.

**The `[console]` settings are the only thing in the simulator that alters a byte. Every
serial LINE is 8-bit clean. There is no knob anywhere on any board that masks a bit.**

They belong to the console, so they stop where the console does. Send a board's console unit
down a `socket:` or a real `serial:` port and the far end gets the bytes as the guest wrote
them — see *Where the transforms stop*, below, because it is the same rule and it surprises
people.

| Setting | Does |
|---|---|
| `upper` | folds what you type to upper case |
| `strip7in` | clears bit 7 of every character you type |
| `strip7out` | clears bit 7 of every character the guest prints |
| `crlf` | translates line endings |
| `echo` | echoes your keystrokes locally |
| `bell` | rings the terminal bell on `^G` |
| `bsdel` | folds backspace and delete together: `off` (default), `bs` (send BS for both), or `del` (send DEL for both) |
| `stop` | which control character is the STOP key (default `^E`; `attn` is an accepted alias) |
| `base` | `hex` or `octal` — the base the **monitor** prints numbers in. Not a transform: it changes nothing about a byte crossing the console, only how a number is spelled back to you. The *Monitor* document has it. |

Set them with `CONSOLE k=v`. (`SET CONSOLE k=v` is the same thing said longer.)

```
swtpcsim> CONSOLE strip7out=on
swtpcsim> CONSOLE upper=on crlf=off
swtpcsim> CONSOLE stop=1D
```

`stop=1D` moves the escape key from `^E` to `^]`. **It must be a control character** — a
STOP key you can type by accident in the middle of a sentence is not an escape key, it is a
trap.

### Why it works this way: the high bit

Some period software sets **bit 7 of the last character of every message** — a string
terminator, the way a routine knows where its text ends — and sends it. Run it with the
transforms off and a word like `SIZE` comes out `SIZ` followed by a garbage character: the
program is not broken. `E` is `45`; with bit 7 set it is `C5`, and your terminal prints whatever
`C5` happens to mean to it.

The fix is `CONSOLE strip7out=on`, and the reason the fix lives *there* is the whole
argument:

**On the real machine, the board sent all eight bits.** Nothing masked anything. The board
put `C5` on the wire because that is the byte the program handed it. The Teletype on the other
end simply **did not look at bit 7** — on a Model 33, that is the parity position, and the
printing mechanism does not decode it. It printed `E` and threw the eighth bit on the floor.

Nothing was masked. Something on the far end did not look. **`strip7out` is the terminal not
looking.** It is a property of the thing you are sitting at, and it belongs on the thing you
are sitting at.

### Where the transforms stop

Follow that argument one step further and it tells you something the first time it happens is
alarming. If `strip7out` is your terminal not looking at bit 7, then the moment your terminal
is **not** the thing on the far end, there is nothing there to do the not-looking:

```
swtpcsim> CONSOLE strip7out=on
swtpcsim> CONNECT mps0:tty socket:2323
mps0:tty: connected to socket:2323
```

Telnet in, and the high-bit garbage is back — exactly as though you had never set `strip7out`.
The same is true of `upper`, `crlf`, `echo`, `bell` and `bsdel`, and it is true of a `serial:`
port as well as a socket.

**Nothing has been undone.** The console settings are still on and still doing their job; the
byte simply no longer goes through the console. It goes board → socket → your telnet client,
and every hop on that path is 8-bit clean — which is the rule at the top of this section, not
an exception to it. A transform that *did* travel down the cable would be a filter on a line,
and the previous two sections are about why that is the one thing this simulator will not do.

So set the equivalent where it now belongs — on the terminal that is actually displaying the
text. Every terminal emulator and telnet client has these, under its own names: strip parity or
7-bit display for `strip7out`, local echo for `echo`, newline or CR/LF handling for `crlf`.
That is not a workaround; it is the same fix in the same place, one machine further out.

### The built-in terminal has these too — in `[terminal]`

There is one terminal one machine further out that *is* the simulator's: the built-in
`terminal` window from *A terminal in its own window*, above. It draws the text itself, so it
is the simulator that must do the not-looking — and it gives you the same knobs the console
has, under `[terminal]` instead of `[console]`:

| Setting | Does |
|---|---|
| `upper` | folds what you type to upper case |
| `strip7in` | clears bit 7 of every character you type |
| `strip7out` | clears bit 7 of every character the guest prints |
| `cr` | `cr` (default, pass the guest's CR through) or `crlf` (add an LF after every CR) |
| `echo` | echoes your keystrokes locally, for half-duplex software |
| `bell` | passes `^G` through to the terminal (default on) |
| `bsdel` | folds backspace and delete together: `off` (default), `bs`, or `del` |

Set them with `SET TERMINAL k=v`, read them back with `SHOW TERMINAL`, or put a `[terminal]`
block in a machine file. Like `[console]`, it is one section for the machine — the window it
applies to is whichever `terminal` line is open.

```
swtpcsim> CONNECT mps0:tty terminal
swtpcsim> SET TERMINAL strip7out=on
```

`strip7out` earns its keep here on an **even-parity monitor** — one that computes parity *into*
bit 7 of every character, so it sends a carriage return as `8D`. To a console that is masked
away; to the raw terminal window `8D` is not `0D`, so it prints as a glyph and the cursor never
returns to the left — every line feeds without a carriage return. `strip7out=on` is the fix,
exactly as it is for the high-bit prompt above. `cr=crlf` is the neighbouring tool, for the
rarer guest that sends a bare CR and expects the terminal to supply the LF.

STOP is the other half of the same fact: it is intercepted at **your keyboard**, before any
board is offered the byte, and it is never looked for on a socket or a serial line. A `05`
arriving down a cable is a byte of somebody's protocol, and scanning a modem line for a key
that exists only on the operator's terminal would corrupt data rather than help.

What *does* travel is the board's own line coding — baud, data bits, parity, stop bits — because
that belongs to the board and not to you. That is the section after next.

### Why not just strap the board to 7 bits

Because it would work, and then it would silently destroy your data.

Set a 7-bit mask on the board — or a filter on the line — and the high-bit prompt comes out clean.
It also **silently corrupts every XMODEM transfer through that port**, because XMODEM sends
binary, every byte of it matters, and bit 7 is a real bit in half of them. The file arrives.
The checksums even pass on a bad packet often enough to be maddening. And the corruption is
in the *plumbing*, which is the last place anyone looks.

**A line may carry binary. A terminal is not a line.** The transform belongs to the terminal
because only the terminal knows it is displaying text.

### `data_bits` and `parity` are real hardware, and are not this

A board genuinely does have `data_bits`, `stop_bits` and `parity`, and they are genuinely
configurable, because a 6850 genuinely has those straps. They are **a FRAME** — they describe
what physically travels down the wire, bit by bit, and on a real serial port they are what
the far end must agree to or it will read garbage.

They are never a mask. `data_bits=7` is not "and the byte with `7F`". It is "put seven data
bits in the frame", which is a statement about the wire, not about the byte the guest wrote.
Do not reach for it to fix a prompt.
